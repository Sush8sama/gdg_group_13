## Overview of all the costs and interests on your current account

A Statement of Fees is a total overview of all costs you paid to ING over the course of the year for the provision and use of your current account in euros or in foreign currency. The Statement of Fees also includes the total amount of interest you received from ING or paid to ING on the balance in your account. You will receive a Statement of Fees every year.

## Who, why, when and how

* ### Who?
All natural persons who have a current account with ING for personal use in euros or in foreign currency will receive a Statement of Fees (one per currency). In other words, this includes all customers with an ING Green Account, an ING Lion Account, an ordinary ING current account, an ING Go to 18 account, an ING basic bank service account or an ING foreign currency current account.
* ### Why?
Your Statement of Fees is issued on the basis of the European directive for current accounts (Payment Accounts Directive – PAD). In Belgium, this directive has been converted into a Royal Decree and included in the Belgian Economic Code. One of the aims of the directive is to provide more clarity on the costs banks charge for using personal current accounts, both in euros and in foreign currency.
* ### When?
From 2021 (for the costs and interest incurred in 2020), you will receive a Statement of Fees every year. When you close your account, you will still receive a Statement of Fees for the year to date.
* ### How?
The way you receive your Statement of Fees depends on your communications preferences for account statements: it will either be sent electronically or in the post.

## For information only

Your Statement of Fees is intended for information purposes only. As such, there is nothing you need to do. As it gives you an at-a-glance overview of all costs charged over the past year, it does serve as a handy way to gain more insight."

The **fidelity premium** is only earned on amounts that have remained uninterruptedly in the regulated savings account for 12 months following the day of the payment. The rate of the fidelity premium in force at the time of payment or the start of a new period remains unaltered for a period of 12 months. Fidelity premiums that have already been earned are paid into your account on the first day following the quarter in which they were earned or when you close your account.
The **base rate interest** starts to accrue on the day after the money is paid into the account and continues up to the day it is withdrawn. It is paid into your account on a yearly basis, on the 1st of January, or when you close your account.
Interest rates are gross and expressed on an annual basis and may be adjusted at any time. You can find the current rate online and at any ING branch. If the rate changes, we inform account holders on their account statements.

## Risks

**Risk of bankruptcy:** In the event of bankruptcy or the risk of bankruptcy of the financial institution, the saver bears the risk of not recovering his or her savings or may be obliged to reduce/convert the amount of his or her claims against the financial institution in excess of 100,000 euros - an amount covered by the deposit protection mechanism - into capital shares (Bail-in). You can find out more about this protection system on the following website
Guarantee Fund for financial institutions (belgium.be)

https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/joint-account;1;7;7.7169317815293985271.txt;"# Joint accounts - ING Belgium

## What is a joint account?

A joint account is a current account held by two or more people and used to manage shared expenses. It operates in the same way as a standard current account and gives all holders access to the funds in the account. Each holder can withdraw cash, make online payments or check their available balance. In addition, thanks to a reciprocal proxy system, each party can make payments without the need for a joint signature.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of joint accounts?

While merging bank accounts is a sign of trust and unity, it's important to make sure it's the right decision for you.
Advantages:
* Convenience. Everything is in one place, which helps to control money inflows and outflows. What's more, when you share costs such as rent, service charges or car expenses, it's much easier to do it with one single transaction from the same account.
* Equality. In the case of a couple, a joint account can be a fair way of sharing the funds, even if each person's income is different.
* Transparency. Such a system makes it possible to know exactly what you and the other holder(s) are spending your money on, which makes it easier to balance the accounts.
Disadvantages:
* Lack of control. You have no control over how the other holder(s) spend the money and there is the risk of potential excesses.
* Risk of conflict. With this account, you will know how much the other holder(s) spends and on what, which can sometimes lead to difficult discussions.
While these are general points that will help you decide whether a joint account is right for you, the first thing to do is to discuss it with your partner/roommate and decide what's best for you.

### Manage all your accounts via the app

With the ING Banking app you can monitor each of your accounts and easily manage your income and expenditure on both your personal and joint account."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/joint-account;2;8;8.7169317815293985271.txt;"# Joint accounts - ING Belgium

## Pro tip: Try the hybrid approach!

In addition to a joint account, you can of course always keep your personal account(s). Many couples opt for a hybrid approach. Their salary/income is paid into their respective personal accounts. A direct debit is set up to transfer an agreed amount into a joint account each month to cover mutual expenses. Having both a joint bank account and individual bank accounts can help equal out the expenses making spending a little more equal depending on each person's income.
Whatever your decision, the most important thing is to be on the same wavelength with your partner or flatmates from the outset."

Reading time: 3 min 28 July 2024 Are you thinking of opening a current account to teach your child about money? Great idea! What are the possibilities and risks associated with bank accounts for children? At what age can my child have a youth account? When should you give your child a bank card?
We answer your most frequently asked questions to help you choose the children’s account that's right for them.

## When can a child have a current account in their own name?

Belgian law does not specify a minimum legal age for holding a current account. Each bank sets its own age limit. At ING, for example, a young person's current account can be opened in the name of a minor from the age of 0. Except in exceptional cases the bank will require that one or both parents, or the guardian, open the account in the name of a minor. From the age of 10, minors may (with the agreement of their parents/guardian) manage their own account, taking account of certain limits.
Good to know At ING we often use the term “current account” to refer to the “sight deposit account”.

### What to do when a child isn't old enough yet to have their own current account?

A child can have a savings account in his or her name from the time they are born. That way, you can start putting money aside for the future as soon as possible and benefit from compound interest.

## What can a youth account be used for?

For your child, having their own account is a way of moving towards independence. For you as a parent, it's a way for them to learn about finance . The youth current account offers several advantages . For example:
* With their own account, your children can manage their pocket money (and you can pay them very easily using a standing order, if you wish).
* Your friends and family can pay money directly into your child's account on such occasions as their birthday or other celebrations.
* From the age of 16, your child can easily receive their student job wages directly into their current account."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/choose-a-child-bank-account;2;24;24.7385350576788705810.txt;"# Child bank accounts: how to choose one - ING Belgium - Choosing a child bank account: we reveal all

## Who manages a child's bank account?

Your child is the sole holder of the current account in their name, even before they turn 18. However, parents retain the right to manage their minor child's account. This gives you an overview of their spending.

## Can a child have a bank card?

As a general rule, a child under 18 can have a debit card , although the conditions vary from bank to bank. There is no official legal minimum age in Belgium for having your own bank card. At ING, for example, a child can have their own debit card from the age of 10, with the agreement of their parents or guardians.

## What are the specific features of a youth account?

Before opening a payment account for your child, you're probably wondering about the possible risks. Having a current account is never without risk. However, youth accounts specifically designed for minors are particularly safe. For example:
* A youth account cannot have an overdraft.
* Parents can set a daily expenditure limit.
In addition, a youth current account can feature specially adapted services. For example, at ING, a child can withdraw as little as 5 euros at a time.
So, a youth account can be a useful tool if you decide to give your child pocket money to teach them how to manage their finances.

## How much does a current account cost for a child?

In Belgium, there are generally no charges for youth accounts. Once your child has reached the age of 18, you will be notified of any changes to the price conditions."

## A current account or savings account for your child?

## Frequently asked questions

### What’s the difference between an ING Green Account and the ING Do More Pack?

The **ING Green Account** is a stand-alone bank account costing €4.50 per month. It qualifies as the Universal Bank Service.
The ING Do More Pack is a more complete bank account pack, including the ING Green Account as well as two additional insurance products, and an optional Visa Classic credit card free for one year. The ING Do More Pack costs just €1.90 per month when you deposit your salary (or other income of minimum €700 per month) to your bank account. Otherwise this pack costs €5 per month.

### What should I do if I encounter an error when applying to open a current account?

First check that the details you have entered are correct. It is also possible that your identity card is no longer up to date in our system. You can update your identity card by entering its PIN code at the Kiosk in an ING branch. It may also be a technical problem. Please try with another browser or reset your browser cookies.

### Do I need a business current account if I am a self-employed or a legal entity?

**As a legal entity (company)** , you are legally obliged to have a separate account.
**As a self-employed person** , it is more efficient if your personal and professional payment transactions are separated:
* Professional account fees are tax deductible;
* It is easier for your accountant to justify each transaction;
* If you do not have a professional account for your business, the tax inspector will examine the private account you use professionally.

### ING+ deals Belgium

**ING+ deals Belgium** aim to provide customers with advantages in the form of discounts valid for purchases from its commercial partners. As part of the ING+ deals, ING in Belgium organises one or more time-limited Promotions each year. For each Promotion, ING in Belgium provides the list of participating commercial partners as well as the benefit(s) they are offering through its Home’Bank/ING Banking services. These benefits are guaranteed within the limits (terms and/or conditions) set out in the commercial partner’s offer. To participate, ING in Belgium customers must sign up for the Promotion on the «ING+ deals» page of ING in Belgium’s Home’Bank/ING Banking services. Before signing up for a Promotion, the Customer must provide details of an account into which all the discounts due in respect of the Promotions will be refunded. The Customer must be the holder or joint holder of this account, which must be an ING Lion Account or an ING Green Account with ING in Belgium.
*Reimbursements are calculated automatically and transferred to the ING current account of your choice, within the period described in the partner conditions* : > following the date of the Customer’s purchase as referred to in the Promotion, or if a right of renunciation/withdrawal to be exercised in respect of the commercial partner is applicable for the purchase made as referred to in the Promotion, > following the end date of the renunciation/withdrawal period defined by the terms and conditions of the commercial partners’ offers, provided you have not exercised this right of renunciation/withdrawal. If this right is exercised, the Customer automatically loses the right to have the discount refunded for the Promotion in question. The aforementioned period will in any case never exceed 45 calendar days from the date of the Customer’s purchase as referred to in the Promotion.
A Customer may sign up for a Promotion at any time during its validity period. If the Customer signs up for an ongoing Promotion, they will nevertheless benefit from all the advantages related to the Promotion in question throughout its duration, in accordance with the terms and/or conditions set out in the offer from the commercial partners and for all purchases, even if purchases were made before signing up for the Promotion. However, in order to benefit from the reduction offered on online purchases in connection with a Promotion (provided this option is offered in connection with the Promotion in question), the Customer must first log in to the «ING+ deals» page of ING in Belgium’s Home’Bank/ING Banking services and click on the offer of the commercial partner in question in order to be redirected to the website of the commercial partner in question."

Reading time: 3 min 08 July 2024 Are you an expat looking to open a bank account in Belgium?
This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about expat banking in Belgium. From the conditions and required documents to the services offered by various banks in Belgium, we have all the information to help you navigate the process as a non-resident.

## Can you open a bank account in Belgium when you are an expat?

Of course. If you want to prepare for your expatriation to Belgium and open a bank account before you move, you can do so under certain conditions. These conditions vary depending on the bank.
At ING, for example, you can open an account as a Belgian non-resident provided that you:
* prove that you intend to work in Belgium (employment contract)
* come to settle in Belgium, i.e. officially have your residence in Belgium.
This is subject to acceptance by ING.

### Good to know!

A Belgian non-resident or a non-resident in Belgium? Although the difference may seem tiny, it is in fact very significant. Indeed, a Belgian non-resident is a Belgian who does not live in Belgium, whereas a non-resident in Belgium refers to a person who does not live in Belgium and who does not have Belgian nationality. This refers to the specific case of foreign expatriates who have not yet settled in Belgium but who intend to do so in the near future. Note also that to be considered a Belgian resident, you must have your residence or wealth in Belgium.
If you are Belgian and live abroad, you can consult this article ."

## How do I open a bank account in Belgium as an expat?

If you do not (or not yet) live in Belgium, you can start preparing your account opening application online, then finalise it in a branch when you arrive.
At ING, you can even use your own ID papers if you don’t yet have your Belgian resident card. Here’s how to do this at ING:
* Before starting the procedure, make sure you have the following supporting documents at hand:
  + your identity papers;
  + a proof of your address abroad;
  + a proof of your link with Belgium (e.g. a contract with an employer, recurring business, real estate, first-degree family, etc.);
  + the CRS (Common Reporting Standard) declaration completed and signed by you (available online).
  + You can be asked other questions depending on your personal situation.
* Start your request online and finalise it in an ING branch when you arrive. Once your account is open, you will get an IBAN number and a SWIFT/BIC code in a few working days. Once your applications have been accepted, you will be able to order a credit card.
However, depending on the situation in certain non-European countries, you may have to finalise your account application at an ING branch.

## Belgian current account for expats: what services are available?

You can carry out your usual banking transactions online, except for investing. Only a person who resides in Belgium can avail himself or herself of online banking services to make investments."

## Which bank to choose in Belgium when you are a non-resident?

28 February 2025 The most common reason is that your device is running an outdated operating system (OS).

Unfortunately, the ING Banking app does not work on devices that run an earlier OS.
If this applies to you, try installing the latest OS on your device, then update the ING Banking app.
If that doesn't work, try uninstalling the app and downloading it again.

## FAQ

### How to update the OS of my Apple Device

* Go to 'Settings'.
* Scroll down and tap on 'General'.
* Tap on 'Software Update'.
* If a new update is available, tap on 'Download and install'.

## The feature that gives you detailed insight in your spending behavior.

What do you spend your money on? Are you curious about your monthly car costs? Or maybe you are wondering how much you spent on your groceries last month?
Then we have something new for you: 'Your budget' is your financial partner if you want to know where your money is actually going.
Knowing your financial habits can help you to remain in control of your budget!
* All your income and expenses broken down into categories
* Easy overview of your spending patterns
* Compare categories across months

## The feature

### What can you expect?

'Your budget' automatically distributes all your transactions in predefined categories giving you an immediate and easy overview of your budget allocation. Fixed expenses, shopping, transport, bar & restaurants, ... : we have foreseen a large set of categories for you. Sub-categories are available as well in case you want an even more detailed view.
You can find this feature via the new ‘Insights’ tab in the bottom bar menu of our mobile banking app. You can check categorised transactions for each current account you are holder of or which you have a mandate on.
This feature will help you to identify where you can reduce spending in case you want to start saving for example. Or you can also simply track how different categories are evolving over time.

## Our tip: use it!

If you want to exploit the full potential of this feature, make sure to use it!
The more you do, the better and the more accurate your insights will become.
* ### Stick to the reality
Only take into consideration what you really spent via the option ‘settle an amount’. Imagine you paid for a group of friends at the restaurant, you can indicate that a part of the money was paid back so that only what you really paid is taken into account for the calculation of the total amount in that specific category.
* ### Make it personal
An auto-categorisation is proposed by us, however you keep the flexibility to re-categorise anytime. You can even decide wether this re-categorisation applies to past/future transactions or only for a specific one."

c. holder or co-holder of any of the following accounts before the start date of the campaign: ING Do More,
ING Do More 18-25, ING Do Basic or ING Green Account.
4. To participate as an “Invitee” to the referral program (hereinafter referred to as “invitee”), an invitee must respect all
the following conditions:
a. be a natural person of minimum 18 years old participating in his or her own name,
b. resident in Belgium,
c. not yet a holder or co-holder of any ING current account for private use before the start of the campaign.
Also invitees who only hold a savings account and are not yet a holder or co-holder of any ING current
account before the campaign start are eligible.
5. For the invitee to participate in the campaign, he/she must successfully open his/her first current account pack at ING,
either an ING Do More or Do More 18-25 (subject to prior acceptance of ING in Belgium, based on its usual policies with
regard to acceptation of customers and mutual agreement) and activate their referral using referral code between
18/08/2025 and 12/10/2025. Additionally, invitees must perform at least 3 transactions before 02/11/2025. These
transactions must be initiated by the customer and may be either debit or credit transactions. Each transaction must
exceed an amount of 0.1 euro.
6. For the inviter, participation is automatic upon sending out an invitation link with the campaign details to the invitees
by clicking on a sharing button, which can be found on the campaign’s information page, from the start date until the
end date of the campaign.
7. Invitees meeting the requirements will receive €50 in their new ING Do More or Do More 18-25 account between
18/08/2025 and 16/11/2025, within 2 weeks after completing the required 3 transactions. The offer is limited to a
single credit transfer of €50 per account (whether it is opened in the name of one or more account holders) and per
person (a single person can only receive the gift for a single account opened in their name). This offer cannot be
combined with other ING offers for the same service.
8. Inviters meeting the requirements will receive €50 per invitee that completed all required actions as described above
in their most recent current account between 18/08/2025 and 16/11/2025, within 2 weeks after the invitee completed
the required 3 transactions. The offer is limited to a single credit transfer of €50 per account (whether it is under the
name of one or more account holders) and per person (a single person can only receive the gift for a single account
opened in their name). This offer cannot be combined with other ING offers for the same service.
9. Inviters can earn a maximum of €500 in total if they invite ten people who fulfill all invitees requirements. The
maximum number of people that can be referred by the inviter is 10. If the number of successful referrals (meaning
a successful account opening by the referral within the campaign period, activation of their referral using the referral
code, combined with making at least 3 transactions before 02/11/2025) exceeds this limit, no rewards will be paid for
these additional invitees, even if they meet all requirements.
10. The campaign is a two-sided campaign, where both the inviter and the invitee can be awarded any reward/s.
11. To be eligible for a reward, the inviter must have an active euro account (meaning it is not restricted, suspended, or
closed) throughout the campaign and at the time ING is due to award the inviter’s account with any reward/s.
12. The allocation of the €50 cannot in any case be challenged, except in the case of gross negligence or intentional
breach on the part of ING.
13. The inviter and the invitee will not be paid a reward if the invitee reverses one of these steps after taking it. For example,
if they close their ING Do More or Do More 18-25 account before the payout of the cash incentive.
14. Employees are prohibited from using their professional information to take advantage of the referral campaign for
themselves, their family or close personal relationships.
15. To verify that the invitee fulfilled all campaign conditions, ING will check the invitee's account transactions during the
campaign.
16. Except in the event of serious or deliberate misconduct, neither ING nor its employees, nor the third parties called
upon in connection with this campaign can be held liable for any damage arising from the organization of this
campaign, including participation in the campaign and the awarding of the credit transfer. Subject to the same
reservation, neither ING nor the aforementioned persons can be held liable for any technical problem occurring during
the course of this campaign in respect of themselves, a participant in the campaign and/or a third party and resulting
in an interruption of the campaign, a delay in the participation in or organization of the campaign or a modification
or loss of the data of a participant in the campaign. If the campaign must be cancelled, interrupted, or modified due
to force majeure or due to any event beyond ING's control, ING shall not be liable for damages and interest.
17. ING may change, suspend, or end the campaign earlier than the end of the campaign period if, in ING’s reasonable
opinion, the campaign is being abused or may negatively affect ING’s goodwill or reputation, or due to unforeseen
circumstances which may make it impossible to continue running the campaign. ING may suspend or end the
campaign on an individual or campaign-wide basis.
18. All participants will lose their right to a credit transfer if it becomes apparent that deceptive practices were used, in
whatever form, or if illegal agreements were made in bad faith between participants to influence their chances of
winning. ING reserves the right, where applicable, to demand the return of the credit transfer or exclude the
participants concerned from any participation in future campaigns and competitions organized by ING. The exclusion
cannot be challenged in any case unless ING has committed serious or intentional misconduct.
19. No information concerning this action will be exchanged, except for the communication of these regulations, available
on https://www.ing.be/competitions and on request, in accordance with these regulations. Complaints regarding
participation in this action should be sent in writing and within 15 working days of the facts. More information on the
complaints process can be found here https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/services/complaint-handling. Only

it.
20. Data provided to ING Belgium in the context of this campaign will be processed by ING Belgium NV, Marnixlaan 24,

## Helping you to better manage your current account balance

Do you know more or less your monthly income and what amounts will soon be deducted from your current account? Will you go below zero or is there room for savings/ investments? Look Ahead is helping you with this!

## Look Ahead is offering various overviews including a view on your balance

* ### ""Scheduled""
An overview of actual scheduled payments, which you can also check at various places within our ING Banking app and Home’Bank.
* ### ""Projected""
An overview of predictions: based on transactions on your current account in the past, we estimate what transactions are likely to occur again. An uncertainty factor needs to be considered in this context.
* ### ""All""
One handy overview of both scheduled and forecasted transactions for your current account.
* ### ""Estimated future balance""
As soon as you start scrolling in the app, you will see the impact of your future transactions on your current balance at the bottom of the screen. The estimated future balance each time takes into account the transaction you just saw as soon as it disappears from the screen. (In Home'Bank this balance is mentioned in the transaction details.)

## What transactions can you see here?

Look Ahead shows the following transactions in relation to your (Euro) current account, looking ahead for 35 calendar days.
* Scheduled outgoing standing orders
* Scheduled outgoing memo payments
* Scheduled SEPA direct debits
* Projected SEPA direct debits(*As SEPA direct debits are known for sure only a few days before these are deducted, we try to already predict those based on your transaction history: you are e.g. paying for energy & telecom every month and based on this pattern, we expect another payment in the future. We advise to take into account a factor of uncertainty for both the projected SEPA direct debits and the projected incoming transactions.)
* Projected incoming transactions
* Scheduled (recurring) money deposits into your investment account(s) (incl. Star Fund)
* Scheduled mortgage repayments (not included: payments made in relation to ‘release of funds’, ex-Record Bank loans and overdue payments)."

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need to download anything?

No, Look Ahead is a feature in the ING Banking app and Home’Bank.

### Is there a charge for this service?

No, it is a totally free tool, part of our banking offer and reserved exclusively for our customers.

### How to deactivate Look Ahead?

You can always deactivate (and if desired also reactivate) via the settings in your ING Banking-app and Home’Bank.

### Why is my overview not complete?

E.g. credit card repayments and personal loan repayments are not included. We are working hard to gradually show more recurrent transactions in the overview. We will, however, never be able to show a complete overview of future transactions. That is why Look Ahead should not be considered as ""your future situation"", but it does offer a valuable heads-up that can help you manage your finances.

### Why the name “Green Account”?

This account has no environmental or social characteristic, it is not considered as a sustainable product.
The « Green Account » was the main account of “Banque Brussel Lambert”, which was taken over by ING.

What to do to get your new debit card? You don't have to do a thing! You will automatically receive the card in 2024 or 2025. All debit cards will be replaced and you will be notified by a text message, a message in your ING Banking app/Home'Bank or an e-mail once your card has been sent. After this notification, all you have to do is to keep an eye on your mailbox and activate the card once received."

### How does a reservation for a transaction with a debit card work?

Reservations for debit card transactions concern funds that are temporarily blocked on your bank account to ensure that your account has the necessary funds and to protect you against the risk of irregular debit.
How does reservations work?
1. Initial authorisation: When a transaction is initiated, the merchant makes an authorisation request to ING, which checks whether your available amount is sufficient to cover the maximum amount of the transaction.
2. Funds reservation: If the authorisation is granted, the funds are reserved, which temporarily reduces the available amount on your account. The amount of this reservation can be adjusted later. Example:
- Buying fuel: the initial amount of the reservation is set by the merchant
and is greater than the potential purchase. Once you have filled up, the
reservation is adjusted to the actual purchase amount and your available
amount is updated.
- Guarantee (hotel, car rental, etc.).
- Transactions in foreign currency: the reservation in euro is an estimated
amount. The final amount of the transaction will be determined based
on the exchange rate at the time of processing.
3. Transaction processing: The transaction is then processed by the merchant. This process can take from a few minutes to several days. Once the transaction has been finalised, the funds reserved are either confirmed and debited from your account or cancelled.
Consequences for the cardholder:
* Reduced available amount: The amount reserved is temporarily inaccessible, affecting the amount available for other transactions.
* Reservation time: This process can take from a few minutes to several days, depending on the merchant's practices.
* Cancellation: If a purchase is cancelled, the funds reserved will be released as soon as the merchant informs us."

This new ING debit card with the Mastercard logo offers you a wider coverage for online payments and in-store outside of Europe (wherever you find the Bancontact or Mastercard logo). The Maestro network will gradually disappear for all banks over the next few years.

### Are there any additional costs associated with this card?

No, the replacement card is free of charge

### What PIN code should I use with this new card?

You keep your current PIN code. However, the card must be activated using the PIN code either when making a payment in a shop or when withdrawing cash from an ATM.
If you have requested the replacement of your debit card for fraud suspicion, loss or theft or because you have not received the debit card you ordered, a new PIN code will be linked to the new debit card you receive.
If you don't remember your PIN, you can check it via the ING Banking app. Check the PIN code of your debit card - ING Belgium

### How to activate the mobile payments with my new debit card ?

To make mobile payments, add your card via the ING Banking App:
- Apple Pay: Services > Settings > Apple Pay- Google Pay: Services > Settings > Google Pay - Click to Pay: Services > Settings > Click to Pay
- Bancontact: Services > Settings > Mobile Payments > Linked Cards"

## Questions about the debit card with Bancontact and Mastercard logos

### What is the difference with a credit card?

If you have a credit card, you should continue to use it to book flights, hotels or car hire.
If you use your debit card to make such expenses, the amount of the transaction will be debited directly from your current account balance. The amount reserved will be blocked on the ING current account and released once the transaction has been completed.
Insurances are often linked to your credit card and the expenses made with this card are only debited once a month from your current account. If you have an ING Do More package, you also have two insurance policies.

### Can this card be used online?

Yes but you must first activate your card using the PIN code by paying in a shop or withdrawing cash from an ATM.

### Will my online payments automatically be saved?

Yes, as long as you save your new card number directly on the webshops/websites you regularly use.

### Can I use my new card outside Europe?

Yes, you can use your debit card worldwide."

## Questions about the debit card with Bancontact and Mastercard logos

### What is the purpose of the CVC code on the back of the card?

The Card Validation Code on the back of the card can be used, as with a credit card, to make online purchases or reservations. It is additional proof that you are the cardholder. This code is as confidential as your card number."

Reading time: 3 min 16 July 2024 Teaching a child about the value of money from an early age is a very wise move.
Opening a bank account for your child is probably the best way to save for children and it can help them learn about financial management. But at what age can a child have a current account? Here are some of the possible options.

## When can a child have his/her own current account?

Belgian law does not set any age limit required to have a current account. However, it does demand that the child be sufficiently aware about money matters.
That being said, the banks can determine themselves the age from which a minor should be capable of managing their bank account.
At ING, for example, a child can manage their own current account from the age of 8. So once your child is deemed to be sufficiently mature to understand the basic principles of money management, you are free to open a current account for them.
However, barring exceptions, a minor cannot open a current account by themselves; the application must be made and signed by the child’s parent(s) or guardian.

### Good to know

At ING we often use the term ‘sight deposit account’ to refer to the current account. It’s a simple semantic variation because it’s actually the same thing!

## What can you do when your child is not yet old enough to have a current account?

A child who does not yet know anything about money and does not need to spend money themselves can nonetheless have a savings account in their own name. You can open a savings account for your child right from birth."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/what-age-can-a-child-have-a-current-account;2;113;113.4528054831122600301.txt;"# At what age can a child have a bank account? - ING Belgium - At what age can a child have a current account?

## How can you know if your child is ready to have a current account?

A child’s age does not always reflect their maturity. So even if a child is of age to have their own current account, it is a good idea to make sure the conditions are right beforehand.
A few questions you should ask to know if your child is old enough to have a current account:
* Do they understand the concept of money?
* Does my child know something about the value of things?
* Do they tend to be a spendthrift?
* What will this current account be used for?
* etc.
With this information you will be better positioned to set the rules for using this account, rules that will be specific to you and your child.
Finally, note that banks already impose a series of fairly strict rules concerning current accounts for minors, such as a daily spending limit (which varies depending on the bank) or an absolute ban on having an overdraft. (You can check out ING’s basic limits at www.ing.be/limits )

## Who is the holder of your child’s current account?

Your child is the holder of their own current account, even while they are still a minor. However, up to the age of 18, the child’s parents/guardians are entitled to manage this account.
Good to know! If your child is old enough to have a student job, i.e. 16, then a current account in their name could be used to lodge their wages."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/what-age-can-a-child-have-a-current-account;3;114;114.4528054831122600301.txt;"# At what age can a child have a bank account? - ING Belgium - At what age can a child have a current account?

## Who can withdraw money from your child’s current account

If your child has a bank card, they can withdraw cash in euros from their account. (You can check out ING’s basic limits at www.ing.be/limits )
In addition, parents can withdraw money from their child’s current account and even, barring exceptions, from their savings account, if it is in the child’s interest.
Note that guardians must respect the powers assigned to them by the justice system."

## Frequently asked questions

### What’s the difference between an ING Green Account and the ING Do More Pack?

The **ING Green Account** is a stand-alone bank account costing €4.50 per month. It qualifies as the Universal Bank Service.
The ING Do More Pack is a more complete bank account pack, including the ING Green Account as well as two additional insurance products, and an optional Visa Classic credit card free for one year. The ING Do More Pack costs just €1.90 per month when you deposit your salary (or other income of minimum €700 per month) to your bank account. Otherwise this pack costs €5 per month.

### What should I do if I encounter an error when applying to open a current account?

First check that the details you have entered are correct. It is also possible that your identity card is no longer up to date in our system. You can update your identity card by entering its PIN code at the Kiosk in an ING branch. It may also be a technical problem. Please try with another browser or reset your browser cookies.

### Do I need a business current account if I am a self-employed or a legal entity?

**As a legal entity (company)** , you are legally obliged to have a separate account.
**As a self-employed person** , it is more efficient if your personal and professional payment transactions are separated:
* Professional account fees are tax deductible;
* It is easier for your accountant to justify each transaction;
* If you do not have a professional account for your business, the tax inspector will examine the private account you use professionally.

### Why the name “Green Account”?

This account has no environmental or social characteristic, it is not considered as a sustainable product.
The « Green Account » was the main account of “Banque Brussel Lambert”, which was taken over by ING.

To participate, ING in Belgium customers must sign up for the Promotion on the «ING+ deals» page of ING in Belgium’s Home’Bank/ING Banking services. Before signing up for a Promotion, the Customer must provide details of an account into which all the discounts due in respect of the Promotions will be refunded. The Customer must be the holder or joint holder of this account, which must be an ING Lion Account or an ING Green Account with ING in Belgium.
*Reimbursements are calculated automatically and transferred to the ING current account of your choice, within the period described in the partner conditions* : > following the date of the Customer’s purchase as referred to in the Promotion, or if a right of renunciation/withdrawal to be exercised in respect of the commercial partner is applicable for the purchase made as referred to in the Promotion, > following the end date of the renunciation/withdrawal period defined by the terms and conditions of the commercial partners’ offers, provided you have not exercised this right of renunciation/withdrawal. If this right is exercised, the Customer automatically loses the right to have the discount refunded for the Promotion in question. The aforementioned period will in any case never exceed 45 calendar days from the date of the Customer’s purchase as referred to in the Promotion.
A Customer may sign up for a Promotion at any time during its validity period. If the Customer signs up for an ongoing Promotion, they will nevertheless benefit from all the advantages related to the Promotion in question throughout its duration, in accordance with the terms and/or conditions set out in the offer from the commercial partners and for all purchases, even if purchases were made before signing up for the Promotion. However, in order to benefit from the reduction offered on online purchases in connection with a Promotion (provided this option is offered in connection with the Promotion in question), the Customer must first log in to the «ING+ deals» page of ING in Belgium’s Home’Bank/ING Banking services and click on the offer of the commercial partner in question in order to be redirected to the website of the commercial partner in question."

## Help your child save money easily and automatically!

You’re never too young to start learning good saving habits. Saving a little every time you make an eligible payment is a fun way to save without realising. Just watch as all the small amounts add up!

## What is ING Save Up?

ING Save Up is a free service that helps you save money by rounding up certain payments you make from your current account to the next euro. At the end of each day, the total of these rounded-up amounts is transferred to your savings account.
What are the conditions to use this service?People who want to use ING Save Up need to:
* be at least 10 years old
* hold both a current account and an eligible savings account at ING.
How do you activate ING Save Up for your child? If you’ve given your child full rights(*At the opening of a savings account for your child you can choose to provide the child with the right to manage their own money if they're over 10 years old. You can change this in your local branch.) to both accounts, they can activate the service themselves in the ING Banking app. *Otherwise you, as legal representative, can activate ING Save Up on the account of your child using your own app.*"

## Save even faster with the savings accelerator

Activate the savings accelerator and they’ll save even more. Every time money is rounded up and transferred from their current account to their savings account with ING Save Up, the amount is tripled.
Here’s an example. If your child buys a drink for €2.40, regular ING Save Up rounds it up to €3.00 and they save €0.60. If they turn on the savings accelerator, the amount transferred to their savings account is tripled to €1.80.

### Why should I use the ING QR Code?

This QR code is the latest way of logging into ING's digital channels. It is easy, 100% secure and fully mobile.

### What should I do with my old ING card reader?

If you don't have a smartphone or tablet, or you can't install the ING Banking app and/or the itsme® app, or you simply want a backup, you can keep it.
If you no longer need the card reader or it no longer works, please recycle it as a small electronic item at your local recycling centre or collection point for small electronic items. You can find collection points on Recupel's website.

### What should I do if I don't have a smartphone?

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between the ING QR Code and itsme®?

They are both ways of identifying yourself and signing payments. The ING QR code is exclusively for doing your banking as an ING customer. Itsme®, on the other hand, has other applications, such as logging into your profiles on government websites, etc.
When you use the QR code to sign a payment, you get to see more information about the payment than when you use itsme®. This is important to guard against phishing. The more information you see, the easier it is to tell if something is not right."

Reading time: 5 min 22 April 2024 When your child turns 18 there are a lot of changes. One of them is that they become legally independent and therefore the owner of their bank account. But sometimes a little expertise from their parents can be a big plus.

## From a child to an adult

Your child is almost 18. You are preparing for all the changes that this will bring. Some of these have to do with their bank accounts - current and savings accounts - that you were able to manage for all those years, making sure they did not overspend on useless stuff!
But what now? Will you still be able to guide them with their finances?

## Legal capacity and ownership

Eighteen is the age at which the law decrees that a child is no longer a child. Where previously their parents were their legal guardian and responsible for them, now they take charge of their own destiny.
The bank sees this no differently. As a new adult, they become the full owner of their bank account and all the cash in it.
As such, their previous legal guardian (e.g. their parent) loses any control over it and any ability to view it.
You’ll no longer be able to consult the account on Home’Bank, and you won’t be able to make any payments in your child’s place, unless they decide to give you the authority to do so. Find out how that works below.

## Granting access again through a power of attorney

If your young adult agrees, you can be added to their account again. They can grant you something called a “power of attorney”.
There are 2 options:
* Unlimited power, you have the same access as before
* Limited power, you can keep an eye on their finances, but you can’t make payments
Unlike the access you had before, your child can modify or even delete your power of attorney whenever they want.
Also, a power of attorney means that any action you are allowed to take you will take in the name of the holder of the account. This means that they are responsible for your actions.
How to set up a power of attorney"

## How to set up a power of attorney

When you turn 18, you also have to deal with administrative formalities.
As far as the bank is concerned, from the day they turn 18, your child has to provide us with certain details, approve the general terms and conditions and read certain documents relating to the accounts they hold.
Whatever the challenges that come their way, you will be on hand to help them to navigate them and, of course, you’ll continue guiding them in their new adult life."

## Verification of payee in a nutshell

* ### Prevention
This feature will prevent some types of fraud cases and payment errors
* ### Immediate result
Once the name of the beneficiary and the account number of the beneficiary (IBAN) are encoded, you get an immediate result of the check.
* ### Release
As from 09/10/25, for channels like the ING app and Home'Bank.

## Short overview

Before signing an SCT, instant or non-instant, ING will conduct the “Verification of the name of the payee” service. This new service aims at verifying the correctness of the combination between the beneficiary's name and the beneficiary’s account number (IBAN).
This service is part of the European Instant Payments Regulation coming into force on October 9th 2025.

## Scope of the service

Release on **09/10/2025** : the service will be provided to retail and business customers initiating SCT’s via mobile app and Home'Bank. The service will then cover SCTs towards all SEPA countries."

## FAQ

### What are the benefits for customers ?

* Increases confidence that your money reaches the right person.
* Automatic verification by the bank saves time and avoids errors.
* Helps preventing fraud, such as invoice fraud.

### How does it work ?

* When you submit a transfer order, your bank checks with the beneficiary's bank to ensure that the account number (IBAN) and the beneficiary's name match. As a customer, you don't need to take any additional steps, as this verification is automatic.
* If the name and account number do not (completely) match, your bank will notify you.
* After notification, you can decide whether to make the transfer with or without the adjustments. Nothing changes in this regard, and, as is already the case today, you are responsible for the transfers you make. This notification serves as a warning. If the data does not (completely) match, we recommend that you always verify the beneficiary to avoid fraud and incorrect transfers.

### Possible Verification Results

* The name entered **matches** the beneficiary's name.
* The name entered **almost matches** the beneficiary's name: you may have made a typo, or the name entered is slightly different from the correct one. In this case, the bank will always provide the correct beneficiary's name.
* The name entered **does not match** the beneficiary's name. If you decide to continue without making any changes, the amount may end up with the wrong beneficiary. If the beneficiary is a legal entity, the bank will also provide the correct beneficiary's name.
* In exceptional cases, verification **may not be possible** due to a technical malfunction or because the beneficiary's bank was unable to respond (in time). Your bank will inform you of this.

### What notification do I receive when I enter the correct name ?

When the name entered and the account match, you'll see a green checkbox (?) or a message such as:
""The name entered matches the beneficiary's name."""
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/daily-banking/verification-of-the-name-of-the-payee;3;146;146.7062292792534102347.txt;"# Verification of payee - ING Belgium - Verification of the name of the payee

## FAQ

### What notification can I receive when the entered name is almost correct ?

If you make a mistake in the name or if the name entered differs slightly from the correct name (for example, ""Pierre Dupond"" instead of ""Pierre Dupont""), the correct beneficiary name will be displayed. We recommend that you enter this name again. This message will generally be displayed in blue and will look this way:
""The name entered almost matches the beneficiary's name. Did you mean <correct name>?""

### What message do I get when I enter a name that contains an error ?

When you make a transfer to an **individual** account and the name you entered doesn't match the registered name, for example, Louis Durand instead of Pierre Dupont, you will receive an error message. This message is usually displayed in orange and looks as follows:
""Caution! The entered name does not match the name of the beneficiary. If you proceed without making changes, the amount could be sent to the wrong beneficiary.""
If you make a transfer to a **business** account and the name you entered doesn't match the registered name, for example, Fédération des banques instead of Febelfin, you will receive an error message stating the correct beneficiary name. We recommend using this name. This message is usually displayed in orange and looks as follows:
""Caution! The entered name does not match the name of the beneficiary. The name of the beneficiary is <correct name>. If you proceed without making changes, the amount could be sent to the wrong beneficiary.""

### What message will I receive if no verification can be performed ?

If no verification is possible, for example due to a technical issue or because the recipient's bank did not respond (in time), you will receive a message similar to the one below. Following this notification, you can decide whether to proceed with your transfer, with or without adjustments.
""We cannot check if the name of the beneficiary is correct. If you proceed, the amount could be sent to the wrong beneficiary."""

## FAQ

### What should I do if I receive an error message ?

* Check the payment details and contact the recipient if necessary (note: contact information on a fake invoice may also be falsified).
* After receiving a notification, you can decide whether or not to make a change. As it is already the case today, you remain responsible for the transfers you make.

### What can I do to make my payments go as smoothly as possible ?

In your trusted beneficiary list, always correctly indicate the beneficiary's name (first and last name). If you receive an error message, remember to update the beneficiary's contact information in your trusted beneficiary list to avoid similar errors in the future.
For example, modify a transfer to the beneficiary ""dad"" by specifying your father's legal name. If you don't, you will continue to receive an error message every time.

### Will others see my name when they make a transfer to my account ?

When verifying the payee's name, an individual's name is only displayed if the payer made a small mistake in the name (e.g., ""Dupond"" instead of ""Dupont"") or if the entered name differs slightly from the correct one. In all other cases, your name is not displayed to maximize your privacy.

### Which payments does verification apply to ?

All transfers that you enter yourself and that are made in euros, regardless of the banking channel used (home banking, mobile banking, etc.) to accounts opened with banks in the eurozone.

### Which payments does verification not apply to ?

* Payments in other currencies
* Payments by payment card
* When you do not enter the account number and beneficiary name yourself, for example by scanning a QR code via Payconiq/Wero
* Direct debits"

## FAQ

### What services do Belgian banks provide that go beyond what the legal framework requires ?

A European Payments Regulation (2024/886) provides the legal framework. To protect you as much as possible against fraud, 16 Belgian banks (1) go beyond what this legal framework requires:
* Legal entities: In the event of an error, the correct legal name of the beneficiary is indicated (if available).
* The verification is not limited to payment accounts, but also applies to savings accounts.
* If an account has recently been closed, this is also notified to the payer so that they do not confirm the transfer.
* For legal entities, both names registered with their bank and legal names, acronyms and trade names registered with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (BCE) will be taken into account as far as possible by October 9, 2025 at the latest.
(1) Argenta Spaarbank, Arkéa Direct Bank/Keytrade Bank, Bank van Breda, Bank Nagelmackers, Banque CPH, Belfius Bank, Beobank, BNP Paribas Fortis, CBC Banque, Crelan, Delen Private Bank, Europabank, ING Belgium, KBC Bank, MeDirect, VDK Bank

### What name should I use when transferring money to a joint account?

When transferring funds to an account in the name of two account holders, it is sufficient to indicate the full name (first and last name) of only one of the account holders. It is therefore not necessary to indicate the names of both beneficiaries.

### For which names is verification performed on the beneficiary's account?

For **individuals** , verification is performed based on the first and last names of all account holders, although you only need to provide one first and last name. In the event of a slight discrepancy, only the registered name of the account holder whose name was entered is displayed.
For **legal entities** , verification covers the legal names registered with the beneficiary's bank, as well as legal acronyms and trade names, provided they are registered with the bank and, in Belgium, with the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (CBE), which will be the case no later than October 9, 2025."

### What should I do if one of the notes I deposited at a cash dispenser is suspected of being fake?

You don’t have to do anything, we will take care of it.
This is what happens:
* The ING or CASH point dispenser will withhold the banknote and display a message on the screen alerting you to this.
* As required by law\* we send the suspicious banknote to the National Bank of Belgium for authentication.
  + The banknote is authentic? We credit your account with the amount immediately.
  + The banknote turns out to be fake? Then we’ll send you a certificate by email or post.
Good to know This authentication process can take up to 60 working days. We’ll do our best to get an answer to you as quickly as possible. Thanks already for your patience!

## Cash dispenser fees

### How do I recognize a fake banknote?

Always be vigilant when you receive banknotes. Check their authenticity with these **3 quick tips** :
1. Look at the banknote Hold the banknote up to the light to see through it. A blurred image with its value in figures will appear. This is known as the **watermark** , and must be present in the body of the paper (and not printed on it) and can only be seen in the light. If in doubt, compare the banknote with another so you are sure is genuine. Or place the banknote under a UV lamp, as the watermark does not appear under UV light.
2. Touch the banknote Touch the banknote. The banknote paper should feel firm to the touch, not soft, greasy or crunchy. Run your finger or fingernail over the front of the banknote. You will notice a slight relief due to the ink.
3. Tilt the note Tilt the banknote back and forth and look at the silver stripe or the **hologram** . The hologram shows the value of the banknote in figures and the euro symbol (€). The hologram is shiny, detailed and smooth. A thickening in the area of the hologram could mean, for example, that a counterfeit hologram has been stuck onto the banknote.

### What should I do if the amount deposited at the cash dispenser does not match the amount credited to my account?

Let us know in one of the following ways:
* By logging to Home'Bank
* Via the ING Banking app: Services **>** Payments & Cash > Cash > ATM issue.
* Call our Customer Services on +32 2 464 60 04, Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm

## SEPA, the single euro payments area

Thanks to SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) all payments in Europe are made in the same way. SEPA covers all member states of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra.
Thanks to SEPA, you can use your bank card all over Europe in the same way as in Belgium. All transfers in euro and direct debits in euro are also harmonized in Europe thanks to IBAN and BIC.

## IBAN

IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is a standardized way of writing bank account numbers all over Europe. An IBAN consists of an account number, a country code and a numeric verification key. Find your IBAN number directly on your bank card or in the overview of your ING Banking app.
* Example of an electronic format IBAN: BE61310126985517
* Calculate the IBAN for your account number(s) here now . You can also calculate your IBAN in Home'Bank: go to Info > Calculating the IBAN.

## BIC

BIC (Bank Identifier Code) is a unique code used to identify international banks. When you make an international transfer within or outside Europe, you need to provide the BIC of the beneficiary's bank.
* ING Belgium's BIC code is BBRUBEBB.
* You can find the BIC of other international banks on the Swift website .

## A new European transfer form

A European transfer form has been created for SEPA which replaces the national transfer forms. You can easily manage your transfers in euro with this European form in Home'Bank : go to Daily Banking > Payments and transfers > Domestic Transfers > Add a transfer (European form)."

## Why a rental guarantee?

When you want to rent a flat or a house, you might have to set up a rental guarantee to fulfil the conditions on the lease agreement. By this the landlord and you are protected if one party does not fulfil its obligations (payment of rent, maintenance,…). When you move out and leave the property in the conditions agreed in the rental contract with the landlord, the rental guarantee will be refunded to you.
* Immediately available
* Simple, and free of charge. No opening, closure or management fees.
* Remunerative and fiscally advantageous

## What is a rental guarantee account?

The ING Savings Account is a blocked regulated savings account opened on your name on which you deposit an amount as a rental guarantee, in accordance with your rental agreement. This amount usually consists of two- or three-months’ rent depending on the region and the type of lease contract. The interests generated by the capital are also blocked."

## Characteristics of the ING Savings Account

ING Belgium SA/NV offers this regulated savings account to private individuals. Belgian law applies.
* **Category A** : this is a classic regulated savings account. There are no conditions attached to the base rate and the fidelity premium.
* **Current interest rates** : the base rate is 0,10% and the fidelity premium 1,15%. The base rate is granted the day following the deposit of the amount on the savings account until the release day. It is paid into your account on the value date of January 1 or when you close the account. The fidelity premium is only acquired on amounts that stay on the savings account for at least 12 consecutive months after deposit. The rate of the fidelity premium in force at the time of payment or the start of a new period remains unaltered for a period of 12 months. Those that have already been earned are paid into your account on the first day following the quarter in which they were earned, i.e. 1 January, 1 April, 1 July and 1 October, or when you close your account. Rates are gross rates expressed on yearly basis and can be modified at any time. In case of modification, the holder of the account will be informed via account statements. You can find the current rates online and in all ING branches.
* Risks:
  + Risk of insolvency: in case of bankruptcy or risk of bankruptcy, your savings of up to €100,000 are protected by the guarantee on savings deposits, you may lose savings exceeding this amount or be required to reduce/convert them into shares. More information.
  + Risk of inflation: rising prices (inflation) may negatively impact your purchasing power.
* **Taxation** : You do not pay any withholding tax if the interest generated by your ING Savings Account is less than €1,050. This amount is doubled for accounts opened in the name of a married couple or those in a civil union, i.e. a ceiling of €2,100 (tax paid in 2026 on income earned in 2025). If your interest exceeds €1,050 (€2,100 for a married couple or those in a civil union), you pay 15% withholding tax on the interest exceeding this amount (tax paid in 2026 on income earned in 2025). The fiscal regime applies to a non-professional client who is a natural person, residing in Belgium.
* **Charges** : the opening, the closure and the management of the ING Savings Account are free. The charges for sending account statements to your home are €5.00/year + postage (VAT not due).
* **No fixed duration** : the ING Savings Account is a regulated savings account with an unlimited term. The release of the rental guarantee will lead to closure of the regulated savings account."

### How can I open a rental guarantee if I live with other co-tenants?

There are 2 options: - One of the co-tenants opens the rental guarantee in his/her name, for themselves and the co-tenants. He/she will be solely responsible for gathering sufficient funds, opening the rental guarantee, informing the landlord, and signing for the release of the rental guarantee. This option can be done digitally or at ING branches.
- All co-tenants and the landlord go to an ING branch and open a rental guarantee with multiple holders. The signature of all account holders and the landlord is required for the release of the rental guarantee. This option can be done at your ING branch."

**USA and Japan**
Customers could experience possible problems when withdrawing money from ATMs in Japan and the United States with their Maestro card. ATM providers in Japan and certain regions in the United States have decided to take additional measures against possible fraudulent transactions since April 19th 2023.
Our proposals:
• In the United States, try with another bank's ATM. In Japan, no ATM would accept cash withdrawals with Maestro. The credit card is the only alternative to be able to withdraw money.
• You can still pay with a bank card, both in the United States and in Japan.
• More than ever, it is strongly recommended to have a credit card when traveling to the USA or Japan."

Reading time: 3 min 24 July 2024 Giving your child a bank card can be a pivotal step in teaching them financial responsibility.
A kids’ debit card offers a practical way for young people to learn about managing money, budgeting, and making informed spending decisions. Under your guidance, a kids’ bank card allows your child to gain real-world experience, helping to foster a sense of independence and confidence. And, with the right oversight and tools, parents can ensure their child uses their bank card responsibly and safely.

## At what age can a child have a bank card?

In Belgium, there is no clear legal minimum age for having a bankcard. Each bank sets its own rules.
For example, at ING, the youth account, with a debit card, is available from the age of 10.

## How do you know if your child is ready for a debit card?

There is no precise ideal age, as maturity varies from one child to the next. And, as a parent you might get a good, or not so good, surprise at your child's attitude to money.
Are you wondering whether your child is ready to have their own bank card? Certain factors can guide your choice, such as :
* impulsivity: does your child tend to be impulsive?
* the concept of money: does your child already know about saving and/or budgeting? Does your child know the value of money?
* the relationship with money: how does your child behave with pocket money or birthday money, for example?
Consider the answers just as indicators and no more. In your specific case, you may want and/or need other criteria to help you decide. The important thing is to ask yourself the right questions, the ones that are right for you and your child."

## How should you oversee how your child uses their bank card?

As a parent, you can configure certain options on your child's bank card:
* the daily debit limit: the maximum amount that can be debited from the card each day, whether for a cash withdrawal in euros from an ATM or for payments (at ING, for example, these limits are available at www.ing.be/limites);
* activate contactless mode: whether or not contactless payment is possible;
* use the banking app: you child can manage the bank account on their own smartphone (for example, at ING, Home'Bank or ING Banking app services are available from the age of 12)
Good to know! Until your child reaches the age of 18, you retain the right to manage their bank account and have an overview of their spending (through online services or an application, for example)."

## What can a child do with their bank card?

A bank card can be used for your child's small day-to-day expenses. It also enables them to withdraw cash from any ATM. And that's not all:
* your child can use their bank card abroad to make local payments and/or withdraw money in euros from an ATM (SEPA zone);
* From the age of 16, the ING bank card, for example, can be linked to Apple/Google Pay, which enables them to make purchases using their smartphone or smartwatch.
* share expenses with their friends. The 'payment request' function in an application such as Payconiq enables bills to be split fairly in complete security.
To reduce potential risks, current accounts for minors are subject to certain **limits** (irrespective of the bank):
* a youth current account cannot be in the red under any circumstances (in other words, overdrafts are not permitted);
* a parent/ guardian can set any spending limit they wish (and this limit can be changed later, always by the child's legal representative). (the basic limits at ING are available at www.ing.be/limites)

### A credit card from the age of 18

Young people can have a credit card when they come of age. One of the advantages of a credit card for a young adult is the insurance cover when travelling or shopping online for example."

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the difference between the ING QR Code and itsme®?

They are both ways of identifying yourself and signing payments. The ING QR code is exclusively for doing your banking as an ING customer. Itsme®, on the other hand, has other applications, such as logging into your profiles on government websites, etc.
When you use the QR code to sign a payment, you get to see more information about the payment than when you use itsme®. This is important to guard against phishing. The more information you see, the easier it is to tell if something is not right."

## Term deposits

The ING Term Account is a term deposit that allows you to make a return on capital that you can do without for a fixed period of time, up to 36 months. You know the yield you will be getting right from the start and get a fixed interest rate.
First read this page carefully, then you can open your ING Term Account

## Features

* ### Where?
You can open the ING Term Account on your smartphone using the ING Banking app, on your computer with Home'Bank or in branch.
* ### How long and how much?
You choose how long you want to block your money for. On your smartphone via the ING Banking app or on your computer via Home'Bank: you can opt for a 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month or 24-month term. In a branch: other durations are available, from 1 day to 36 months. If the account is opened in euros, the minimum amount is 1,000 euros. If you open an account in a foreign currency (only at a branch) the minimum amount corresponds to an exchange value of 5,000 euros.
* ### How?
The ING Term Account depends on a reference account (ING Current Account or ING Invest Account) to which it is linked. The titular holders, the proxy holders, as well as the powers of attorney, linked to the ING Term Account are identical to those linked to the reference account. At term, interest is paid into this reference account. For terms of more than one year, you automatically receive interest at the annual maturity date. Once opened, you can easily check the balance of your ING Term Account on your smartphone via the ING Banking app, on your computer with Home'Bank or at a branch. At the final term, the capital and interest are automatically transferred to a savings account of your choice or to the reference account.
* ### Who?
Any individual customer of legal age may apply to open an ING Term Account provided that he/she can carry out transactions from the reference account."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/saving/term-deposit;2;205;205.2130388494079217918.txt;"# ING Term Account - ING Belgium

## Interest Rate

The interest rate depends on the amount, tenor, currency and market conditions. When opening online, the proposed interest rate will appear on the screen before you have to confirm the opening request. For other tenors, given the number of possible combinations, you can contact your branch or the call centre to get an indication of the rate applied.
Only the currency ""Euro"" is available online. The following currencies are available in branch: Euro, US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Swedish Crown, Norwegian Crown, Danish Crown, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand, Yen, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar.
The interest rates are expressed on an annual basis, before deduction of withholding tax, and are valid for the entire duration of the chosen term.

## Charges

Opening, managing, and closing an ING Term Deposit Account at the end of the specified term is completely free. During the first 14 days after opening, you retain the right to close the account free of charge. No interest will be paid if the account is closed within this period. After this period, closure is no longer possible.

## Taxation

Interest is subject to a 30% withholding tax, which is automatically deducted at source by ING.
This tax regime applies to private (non-professional) customers residing in Belgium. Different tax treatments may apply to other individuals.

## Risks

The ING Term account is an ING Bank Belgium SA term account. Belgian law alone applies.
Risk of bankruptcy: your savings of up to €100,000 are protected by the guarantee on savings deposits. In the event of ING going bankrupt or in the event of a risk of bankruptcy, you may lose savings in excess of this amount or be required to reduce/convert them into shares.
Inflation risk: rising prices (inflation) can have a negative impact on your purchasing power.
Foreign exchange risk: in the case of foreign currency term deposits, there is a foreign exchange risk."

## Frequently asked questions

### What is a term account?

A Term Account is an account on which you deposit **a fixed amount** for a **fixed period of time** . At the end of that period the capital and interest will be automatically paid to the ING account of your choice (e.g. current account, savings account or invest account). You get a **fixed interest rate.**
ING Term Accounts are linked to a reference account (ING Current Account or ING Invest Account). The titular holders, the proxy holders, as well as the powers of attorney, linked to the ING Term Account are identical to those linked to the reference account. At term, interest is paid into this reference account. For terms of more than one year, you automatically receive interest at the annual maturity date.
Once opened, you can easily check the balance of your ING Term Account on your smartphone via the ING Banking app, on your computer with Home'Bank or at a branch.

### What is the difference between a savings account and a term account?

* The interest rate on a savings account can change at any time, while with a term account you enjoy a fixed interest rate for the entire term.
* With a savings account you can deposit or withdraw money for free at any time. With a term account, the money is only available at the end of the term.

### What are the advantages of a term account?

* **Fixed interest rate:** the interest rate does not change. You know in advance how much your money will yield at the end.
* **No entry and exit costs at the end maturity:** you do not pay entry and exit costs at the end maturity, as is for instance usualy the case with investments.
* **Various options:** you choose how much and for how long you deposit your money in your term account.
* **Visibility:** you can easily consult your term account at any time in your ING Banking App or Home'Bank."

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the disadvantages of a term account?

* The biggest disadvantage of a term account is that your **money is blocked** for the entire term. You can't withdraw it when you need a little something extra.
* You enjoy a fixed interest rate on a term account, which is usually an advantage. However, this can also be a disadvantage if the interest rate on regular savings accounts were to rise sharply.

### Can you deposit extra money on a term account?

It is not possible to deposit money into a term account. However, you can open multiple term accounts with different amounts and durations at the same time.

### Can you withdraw money from a term account?

It is not possible to withdraw money during the term of the term deposit.
During the first 14 days after opening, you retain the right to close your ING Term Account free of charge. After this period of fourteen days, the ING Term Account can no longer be closed early."

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I transfer funds that I have in an account at another bank to an ING Term Account?

You can transfer money from your account at another bank to your ING current account or ING Invest Account. Money available at ING can be used when opening an ING Term Account."
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/saving/savings-accounts-and-interest-rates-explained;1;210;210.617954169715994878.txt;"# Savings Accounts and Interest Rates Explained - ING Belgium - What is a savings account?

Reading time: 4 min 05 March 2024 A savings account is a bank account into which you deposit money you intend to save. In return, the bank pays you interest, if the interest rate is positive. Savings account interest rates vary by bank and fluctuate over time.

## The purpose of a savings account

The purpose of a savings account is to put money aside for things like unforeseen events, home improvements, holidays or other longer-term projects. In the past, banks offered a paper savings book with a savings account, although increasingly these are managed digitally.
There are two types of savings account:
* Regulated savings accounts
* Non-regulated savings accounts

### For regulated savings accounts, interest is made up of:

* The basic interest which starts accruing the day after your money is paid in
* The loyalty bonus which is earned if your savings remain in the account for 12 months

## A regulated or non-regulated savings account?

Most savings accounts in Belgium are regulated, i.e. they comply with certain rules laid down by law.
A savings account is said to be regulated when, among other things, basic interest and a loyalty bonus are paid into it. If the basic rate and loyalty bonus comply with certain rules, withholding tax is not payable on interest (up to €1,050 interest per year).
A non-regulated savings account does not necessarily comply with these rules. As a result, withholding tax is payable on the first cent of interest.
At ING, we offer a range of regulated savings accounts to meet different savings needs.

## What are the advantages of a savings account?

### What are the advantages of a savings account?

* Free: there is no charge for opening and managing an account.
* Protection of deposits: the money you deposit in a regulated savings account is protected by the Belgian State Guarantee Fund up to 100,000 euros.
* Availability: your money is not blocked in your savings account. You can transfer all or part of your money to your current account at any time, in real time."

## What is an exchange rate surcharge?

First thing to know: you have the exchange surcharge applied if you pay in a currency other than Euro.
Just like other banks, ING calculates an additional rate for all transactions in other currencies than Euro. The tariff surcharge is the amount a person pays for the exchange of one currency to another. This additional rate is expressed within ING as a percentage of the amount you exchange.
Exchange rate for debit cards: 3.9 %\*Exchange rate for credit cards: 2 %\*

### Important

The exchange rate applied is determined by the day on which the transaction is recorded. This date may differ from the date of the actual transaction. The booking date is defined by the retailer / merchant or the ATM network."

### Warning

The ""acquirers"" (= owners) of ATM devices may charge ""access fees"" for each cash withdrawal with Mastercard or Visa.

## Check exchange rates online

Consult the Mastercard , Visa and ECB exchange rates online.
Make sure you have this information to obtain the correct exchange rate:
* **Date** : Enter the date of the transaction (rates appear daily at a defined time. Before you will get the rate of the previous day. There are of course no rates available for future transactions).
* **Currency** : Select the currency in which you want to execute a transaction – eg. Polish Zloty.
* **Amount** : Enter the amount of the transaction eg. 100 PLN.
* **Exchange rate surcharge** : Enter the exchange rate surcharge of the bank, eg debit card: 3.9 %
* Enter Euro for the currency of your account.
?You will then receive a result without ING treatment costs and contribution, which still needs to be added, eg a cash withdrawal at ATM outside the SEPA zone with your debit card: € 4.24 and 0.30 % on the amount withdrawn. If used inside the SEPA zone, only extra cost of 0,5€ when using a Lion Account (ING Do Basic), otherwise it is free."

Reading time: 5 min 14 February 2021 All the answers to questions about this overview of costs and interests on your current account

### Most important aims?

* to make the charges for having and using current accounts in euros or in foreign currency more easily comparable
* to make it easier to switch to another bank
* to guarantee that anyone can apply for a basic current account

### Does not look like a document issued by ING?

The European Directive that gave rise to the Statement of Fees provides specific instructions for what it should look like. No changes can be made to this template, and the bank can only add its logo as prescribed.

### Does a Statement of Fees always cover a full year?

Yes and no. If you have only just opened your account, the Statement of Fees will of course only cover the open period, and if you have closed your account it will only cover the period of the year up to its closure. In all other situations, your Statement of Fees will always cover a full year.

### Why am I receiving multiple Statements of Fees?

Statements of Fees are sent per account, and not per customer. As a result, you will receive a separate Statement of Fees for every account.

### At what point are charges listed on the Statement of Fees?

The value date of the charges taken for a service or transaction determines at what point these charges appear on the Statement of Fees.

### How do I start managing my power of attorneys?

For an **overview** of persons with access to your account or you want to **add** or **remove** a mandate holder, click here .

### What is a power of attorney?

A **power of attorney** is an authority that is granted to one person or more to manage the account in your name. The person receiving this authority is called a **mandate holder** . As such they receive, within their boundaries, a mandate to use your account to make payments and/or to view its balance. You remain the **legal holder of the account** and as such are **responsible for all their actions** .

### Who can benefit from this?

**Not all accounts are eligible** . If you have an ING Do Basic Pack, including a Lion Account, you cannot add any powers of attorney on that account. However, you can if you have an ING Do More pack, including a Green Account, or if you have a Professional Account.
The **mandate holder** **needs to be an ING customer** for you to add them on your account(s) online. If that’s not the case, you can still add someone who is not an ING customer by making an appointment at your branch.

### What does this cost?

This service is **completely free** for all eligible accounts!

### What are the different types of access?

* View: Can view the account statements and balance
* Encode: Can prepare payments and put them in the payment basket
* Sign: Can sign and validate payments (either their own or those in the payment basket)

2. Select ‘Current accounts’ or 'Saving accounts'.
3. Tap 'Close account'.

### Can I download account statements of a closed account?

Yes, that is possible. For each account you will have to make a separate request. It is not possible to close the account which is used to transfer the remaining balance of another account that you are already closing.
If you’re closing your last current account, close all your savings accounts first because you need a current account at ING to transfer your savings to.

Yes, each account holder or individual that has a power of attorney on the account can request the closure through the ING Banking app or Home’Bank .

### What do I do when I receive the message that I can’t close my account online?

Most probably something is preventing us to close the account. Contact us and we’ll help you further.

### How do I close an account with a transfer to an account outside of Belgium?

You can close your account via the ING Banking app or Home'Bank if you have another account within the SEPA zone. If you only have an account outside of the SEPA zone, please contact us and we’ll help you further.

### Do I need to close my credit card or ING Cash reserve before closing the account?

No, it’s not necessary to close your credit card or ING Cash reserve beforehand. It will be closed at the same time as the closure of your account."

END TABLE IN MARKDOWN
When does the cover start and when does it end? The cover starts for the new ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack), from the opening of the account when the insurance cover is included in the account or for the existing ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack), from the date communicated to the account holder when the insurance cover is included in the ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack). All cover terminates immediately and expires automatically in the event of non-renewal or withdrawal from the ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack) or if the present insurance/guarantee contract between ING and AIG is terminated for any reason whatsoever. If the group contract is terminated for any reason whatsoever, no further cover will be granted to the holder of an ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack). By way of example, this means that: for purchase insurance, no additional cover will be granted after termination, even if the items were purchased before the cover was terminated and for ticket cancellation insurance, no additional cover will be granted after termination, even if the tickets were purchased before the cover was terminated.

### My friend doesn’t appear in my contacts list via Payconiq

Please see the previous answer.

## FAQ

### Where can I find ING+ deals?

Would you like to know more about the ING+ deals offered by ING?
* Go to your ING Banking overview and scroll down and tap on 'My ING+ deals cashbacks'.
* Go to your ING Banking overview, click on 'Products' on the left of your screen and select 'ING+ deals'.
* Go to your ING banking overview, click on 'Insights' and select 'ING+ deals' on the top right corner.

### Can I combine ING+ deals with other in-store promotions?

Yes, ING+ deals are clearly differentiated from other actions or promotions that the store offers to its customers. You can therefore perfectly combine these advantages, unless contra-indicated in the terms and conditions of the deal.

### Can I use my joint current account for ING+ deals?

Of course you can. In that case, it’s important that each account holder first activates the ING+ deals. If you choose to do so and the other holder does not, only payments made with your own debit card will be taken into account for the calculation of the discount.

### When will I receive my reimbursements?

In case you do not return your purchase, you will receive your cashback into your bank account in line with the merchant payment conditions mentioned in the offer details.

### How can I track my refunds?

The amount you have saved (and will receive) is available directly on the ING+ deals page.

### Can I use different ING debit or credit cards?

Like many customers, you might have several ING debit or credit cards. These cards are all personal and give you access to the ING+ deals discounts.

### On which current account will I receive my cashback?

The current account on which you receive your cashback is always the same. Indeed, when you registered, you indicated the number of the current account that ING will use for your reimbursements. Regardless of the ING debit or credit card used for your purchases, the registered account is the one that will be used for the repayment of your cashbacks."

## FAQ

### What does the bank switching service include?

Using the bank switching service, the holder of a bank account or accounts can **transfer their payment orders** , which are executed on the former payment account, **to the new payment account** .
The holder of a bank account or accounts **can also request the settlement of the former payment account** .
**The holder of** a bank account or accounts **can choose from the following options** as part of the bank switching service:
* the transfer of all payment orders.
* the transfer of all payment orders and the settlement of the former payment account.
* the provision of information to creditors of direct debits in euro (SEPA) and/or payers of recurring incoming money transfers in euro (SEPA).
* the settlement of the former payment account (without transferring the payment orders).

### Should I transfer my income to ING?

**In theory, this is covered by the bank switching service (see ""payment order"").**
However, if you wish, you can make the switch yourself by communicating the number of your ING current account to your employer or payment agency.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does a credit card work?

Unlike a debit card, payments made with a credit card are not immediately deducted from your bank account. Instead, they are postponed to a later date—often at the beginning or middle of the following month.
**Visa Classic:** each billing period closes on the 27th of the month. The total amount due for that period is automatically debited 9 calendar days later from the ING current account linked to your credit card.
**Mastercard Gold:** each billing period closes on the 7th of the month. The total amount due for that period is automatically debited 9 calendar days later from the ING current account linked to your credit card.

### What fees might I have to pay?

You pay a fixed annual fee (see comparison table above). If you paid in euros and there is enough money in your current account at the time of the monthly closing, no additional fees or interest will apply.
?? Important to know: fees are charged if you withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. That’s why we recommend using your ING debit card for this type of withdrawal whenever possible, both in Belgium and abroad.

### When is it better to use an ING credit card instead of an ING debit card?

?? When making payments in currencies other than euros, because the exchange margin is lower (2% vs 3.9%). However, it’s still best to use your ING debit card for ATM withdrawals whenever possible.
?? A credit card is also very practical for making large purchases at the end of the month, since the amount is only debited from your account later—often at the beginning or middle of the following month.
??? Lastly, every payment made with your credit card is automatically covered by additional insurance. ?? When in doubt, it’s always better to use your credit card for major purchases or holiday bookings."

## If I still have questions?

### How does Zoomit work?

Zoomit makes it easy to pay your bills and manage your financial documents online. From utility and insurance bills to credit notes, pay slips… Zoomit centralizes your financial documents in your online banking environment. And when you want to pay a bill, you no longer have to enter account numbers or reference messages manually. All the payment information is prefilled automatically with a single click.
Once you give your utility company, insurance provider or other senders permission, you will then receive their invoices or other documents in PDF format via Home’Bank, Business Bank and ING Banking. You can then pay and/or archive your Zoomit documents entirely online, however and whenever you want.

### How much does Zoomit cost?

Zoomit is completely free of charge and is part of our online banking service.

### How do I accept new Zoomit senders?

Whenever a sender wants to send you a Zoomit document for the first time, they will appear in your list of new senders. You can approve each new sender individually or agree to accept any and all new senders automatically. You can also choose whether to activate automatic approval for all your accounts or only some of them.

### How do I pay an invoice via Zoomit?

Zoomit makes it easy to pay your utility, insurance and other bills in a few easy steps:
• Select the bill you want to pay • Tap the ""Pay"" button at the bottom • Choose the account you want to use for the payment. You can also add a future execution date if you wish. All the other payment details will be pre-filled. • Confirm the payment

### What kinds of documents can be received via Zoomit?

Zoomit lets you receive a wide range of electronic documents which you can view and manage via Home’Bank, Business Bank or our app for smartphone and tablet. A few examples:
• Utility bills • Insurance bills • Direct debits • Pay slips • Credit notes"

## If I still have questions?

### How long will the documents remain available in Zoomit?

Incoming Zoomit bills and other documents remain in your list of new documents until they are paid and/or viewed. They are then moved to your history. The exact period they remain available for viewing depends on the sender. You can check this under “Document characteristics"". You can also download and save your Zoomit documents on your computer, if you wish to keep a permanent record.

### Can I transfer my Zoomit documents to or from another bank?

Unfortunately, it is not possible to transfer your existing Zoomit documents to or from a different bank since they are linked to your account number. You can, however, easily download and save them on your computer. If you change banks and want to continue receiving bills and other documents via Zoomit, you will need to give your new account number to your approved senders.

### Will I still receive paper documents if I use Zoomit?

Once you give permission for a sender to send you their documents via Zoomit, you will no longer receive them by post. However, there may be a short period of overlap, depending on the sender. Which means you may still receive paper documents at first. After that, you will only receive your documents electronically."

## If I still have questions?

### Can I give someone else access to my Zoomit documents?

By default, everyone who currently has access to your account will be able to view or pay your Zoomit documents, with the exception of personal and confidential documents such as pay slips. This includes all account holders and mandate holders. If you wish, you can also choose to keep your Zoomit documents private. In that case, other account holders or mandate holders will not be able to view and/or pay them.

## Push notifications: useful, not pushy

A big tip: enable the push notifications of your app. We only send notifications for important things that you’ll want to know about straight away. Promise!
For example, for amounts received, amounts paid or if your account balance drops below a certain amount.
Set up your push notifications

## You never know who’s seeing your screen

Don't want to show off your balance? It’s possible to switch to private mode and hide it.
You can decide if you display or hide your balance by default. Then only hide/show it when you decide to.
Go to the Overview > Settings at the top of your screen > Show balances on overview.

## Sign securely with biometrics

Fingerprint or face recognition instead of a PIN-code? Using biometrics is a secured way to prevent people from looking over your shoulder. You can activate this functionality in the settings of the ING Banking app.

## Frequently asked questions

### How secure is itsme® and what happens with my personal data?

Itsme® is an extremely secure way to confirm your digital identity. The system works by linking the unique data contained in your electronic identity card with that of the SIM card in your smartphone. Together with the 5-digit itsme PIN known only by you, this unique mobile identity ensures maximum security for your e-banking and other online services.
No information will be transferred without **your explicit consent** . You can see exactly in the app what data you are sharing, what you are doing and with which partner!

### I turned 16 or 18 and would like to start using itsme®. It’s not working, what should I do?

If you're 16 and you’re having troubles installing itsme®, it’s probably because you still have to share the latest version of your eID card with ING. You can do this by presenting your eID card at the counter of your local ING branch.
If you didn’t get a new eID card when your turned 18 and your old one is still valid, you’ll have to go by the local administration to activate the electronic signature certificates. Afterwards you should be able to create an itsme® account.

## What personal details does ING require?

Keeping your personal details up to date is vital for identification, communication, security and various legal reasons.

### Legal address and contact address

By keeping your address up to date, you can be sure that we are sending important letters to the correct address. Think in this regard of letters with official documents, such as when replacing your bank card or when applying for a new card.
Your **legal address** (or your domicile) is the address where you are officially registered. This information must be correct to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements and by so doing to protect our systems and combat financial crime.
You can update your legal address in a few minutes via itsme®. If you do not have itsme® or your legal address is not yet correct, you have two options:
* You can add the change of address manually in the ING Banking app or in Home’Bank. We will then have to check your address with the government, which can take 2 months. But rest assured: we will start working with your new address immediately and will keep you informed when it is confirmed.
* You can visit a CASH point . In just a few moments, your identity data will be synchronized. You’ll simply need to bring your ING debit card and your ID card.
Are you living at an address other than your legal address? Then we call this your **contact address** . You can enter this if you would like to receive your letters at an address other than your current domicile.
Are you moving abroad? Or vice versa, moving from abroad to Belgium? Find out what you need to do in the ‘Frequently asked questions’ at the bottom of this page.

* **Buyer's guarantee**
* **Internet purchase delivery cover**
* **Extended manufacturer’s warranty**
* **Bicycle Assistance**

* **Travel cancellation insurance**
* **Card fraud cover**
Discover here the insurance offer and how to submit a claim file.
For all other information about these policies, please refer to the general terms and conditions .

### What fees might I have to pay?

You pay a fixed annual fee of €51. If you paid in euros and there is enough money in your current account at the time of the monthly closing, no additional fees or interest will apply.
?? Important to know: fees are charged if you withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. That’s why we recommend using your ING debit card for this type of withdrawal whenever possible, both in Belgium and abroad.

### When is it better to use an ING credit card instead of an ING debit card?

?? When making payments in currencies other than euros, because the exchange margin is lower (2% vs 3.9%). However, it’s still best to use your ING debit card for ATM withdrawals whenever possible.
?? A credit card is also very practical for making large purchases at the end of the month, since the amount is only debited from your account later—often at the beginning or middle of the following month.
??? Lastly, every payment made with your credit card is automatically covered by additional insurance. ?? When in doubt, it’s always better to use your credit card for major purchases or holiday bookings."

We may also rely on checks performed by other financial institutions to verify your identity;
• Credit checks: Before entering into a customer relationship with you for the granting of a credit, we have a legal obligation to check whether you qualify as an eligible customer. We assess your credentials from a risk perspective and predict if you can meet your financial obligations towards us as further detailed in Section 6 (“Do we make automated decisions and engage in profiling?”). Regarding overdraft facilities, we also have the legal

**C) Our legitimate interest**
We process your data for a range of purposes that are in our interests as described below. When relying on legitimate interest, we ensure that processing remains proportionate and that your interests, fundamental rights and freedoms are respected. If you would like more information about our reasoning behind our assessment in a specific case, please contact us using the details provided in Section 12 (“Contact and questions”).
Please find below an overview of the main purposes for which we process your personal data where we rely on legitimate interest:
1. Relationship management and marketing.
To the extent that the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us (unless your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms prevail), we may carry out, without obtaining your prior consent, the following processing:
o the processing relating to the promotion and offer of the best-suited products and services provided by us or other ING entities and/or of such products and services at a differentiated price or (credit or debit) interest rate.
We will process your personal data when informing or advising you (e.g. by e-mail, mail and phone) about (similar) products and services from ING and when performing statistical purposes. Of course, if you do not want to receive these offers you have the right to object or to opt-out. We strive to understand you better and meet your changing needs by offering you services and/or price or interest rate that will suit your specific situation. To be able to provide you with tailor-made products and services and/or differentiated price or interest rate, we may:
• take into account your socio-demographic and financial situation (with the exclusion of your payment details);
• analyse your preferences in our various communications channels;
• analyse the products and services that you have already purchased from us.
We may also send you newsletters informing you about our activities. Of course, if you don’t want to receive these newsletters you have the right to object.
o the processing relating to improvement and development of our products and services.
We may ask you for feedback about our products and services or ask for your opinion on new product ideas. We may share this with certain members of our staff to improve our offering.
Analysing how you use and interact with our products and services helps us understand more about you and shows us where and how we can improve. For instance:
• When you open an account, we measure how long it takes until you are able to use your account;
• We analyse the results of our marketing activities to measure their effectiveness and the relevance of our campaigns;
• Sometimes we analyse your personal data using automated processes, such as algorithms, to speed up credit decisions for loans and mortgages. On the basis of payment data or any other banking, financial or credit data, we may so predefine a maximum limit for the granting of credit in order to be able to respond rapidly to any request for credit from the data subject;
• We may use your personal data when analysing your visit to our website or app with the aim of improving these. We use cookies and comparable technologies for this. For
more information, we refer to our Cookie Statement as published on our site.
• Unless this is not allowed according to applicable law, this can include recording your conversations with us, but we will always inform you about this beforehand.
o the processing relating to the communication of personalised information and offers (""personalised direct marketing"") on the basis of payment data or other similar sensitive personal data (i.e. the use of such data for profiling purposes in the context of marketing), only to the extent that:
• such data is necessary to exclude individuals from marketing activities which are not considered appropriate for those individuals, based on semi-aggregated payment data (e.g. excluding customers from car insurance campaigns based on the absence of vehicle-related expenses, ...), or
• these data are necessary to prioritise marketing activities towards data subjects when the same person is the recipient of several marketing campaigns at the same time (except for the promotion of insurance services), based on a high level of categorisation of payment data (such as total amounts of incomes and expenses, total amounts of expenses on transport, at supermarkets, ...);
o the processing, carried out on the basis of payment data or any other banking, financial or credit data, to provide you with information on your past financial situation (incomes and/or expenses) (e.g. by providing an overview of the amounts spent per category as well as the details of such expenses : transport expenses, supermarket spending, costs of each subscription, ...);
o the processing, carried out on the basis of payment data or any other banking, financial or credit data, to assess in advance whether you are eligible for certain products and services and, if so, to give you the opportunity to subscribe to them. For example, we may look at your payment behavior and credit history when you apply for a loan or a mortgage. We may also look at your payment data to show you which transactions are eligible for ING OneView services or ING Look Ahead services.
o the processing, carried out on the basis of payment data or any other banking, financial or credit data, for credit monitoring. We use and analyse data about your credit history and payment behaviour (including data available from the National Bank of Belgium's credit registers) to assess your ability to repay a loan, in the course of the credit contract, and – as the case may be – to contact you on this topic and/or take appropriate measures.
2. Business process execution, internal management, statistics and management reporting.
We process your data to ensure effective and efficient internal business process execution, statistics and management reporting. We process your data for our internal processes and operations and to help our management to make better data driven decisions about our operations and services. We will always choose aggregated data for this if we can, meaning that only information about groups of clients will be processed (so that you are not identifiable). This includes:
o analysing our market position in different segments;
o performing cost and loss analysis;
o training our staff for example by analysing recorded phone calls in our call centres to improve our calling scenarios;
o automating our processes such as application testing, automatic filling of complaints handling, etc.;
o conducting litigation and complaint management.
3. Safety and security.
We have a duty to protect your personal data and to prevent, detect and contain any breaches of your data. We not only want to protect you against fraud and cybercrime, we also have a duty to ensure the security and integrity of ING and the financial system as a whole.
For instance:
• We may process your data to protect your assets from fraudulent activities online, for example, if you are hacked and your username and password are comprised. In this respect, we process behavioural data
(linked to your use of a mouse, a keyboard, etc.);
• We may use certain information about you (e.g. name, account number, age, nationality, IP address, etc.) for profiling purposes to detect fraudulent activities and the perpetrators;
• As an entity of ING Group, we apply the American administrative sanctions lists, such as the OFAC list (Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Treasury Department), both when entering into a relationship and when carrying out transactions;
• We may use your personal data to alert you if we detect suspicious activity on your account, for example when your debit or credit card is used in an unusual location.
**D) Protecting your vital interests**
We process your personal data when necessary to protect your interests which are essential for your life or that of another natural person. For example, for urgent medical reasons pertaining to you. We will only process your personal data necessary for the vital interests of another natural person if we cannot base it on one of the other purposes mentioned.
**E) Respecting your choice if we request your consent for specific personal data processing**
For certain types of personal data processing, we will provide you with specific information about the process and request your prior consent before processing your personal data. This may include:
• promotional activities where we inform you about products and services from ING partners (such as these from our partners of ING +Deals).
• personalised marketing activities based on profiling performed on the basis of the analysis of your payments data.
With your consent, we may send you letters, e-mails, or text messages offering you a product or service based on your personal profile (based on payment data) or show you such an offer when you log in to our website or mobile apps.
• promotional activities on internet where we inform you about products and services based on your online behaviour. We may use your personal data when analysing your visit to our website with the aim of improving these. We use cookies and comparable technologies for this. For more information, we refer to our ING Cookie Policy as published on our website.
You may withdraw your consent at any time as set out below.

4. the transfer of the data to an archive;

These KYC models incorporate mandatory requirements derived from the EU Directives and Regulations in the area of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Guidelines (BCBS) and EU, US and UN sanctions laws and regulations.
ING Belgium also continues to strive to make its everyday procedures more efficient and effective since it is in our legitimate interest to offer you the best possible services at competitive rates. As such, ING Belgium will share your personal data with ING Group and other ING entities to centralize certain operations to achieve economies of scale, such as:
• For efficiency reasons, certain operational and administrative tasks in relation to the agreements we have with our customers, client management (including fraud/KYC screening) or the processing of transactions have been centralised in processing centres, named ING Hubs located in countries such as Slovakia, Poland, Sri Lanka, Romania and the Philippines. These IBSS entities will process your data on behalf of ING Belgium;
• The development of models mainly related to improving customer processes such as optimisation of account management and product management in customer channels. For efficiency reasons, these models are mainly developed by our analytics department on a group level. Your personal data will be pseudonymised when transferred for this purpose.
• We may use centralised storage systems to process data at a central point within ING for efficiency purposes. For instance, to create different types of credit risk models as mentioned above. These centralised storage systems are operated by ING or third parties, such as Microsoft and might be located outside the EU. In any case, ING will always ensure that adequate measures are in place to safeguard your personal data.
Please note that ING Belgium will remain responsible for ensuring that the processing of your personal data - including any processing carried out by other ING entities on our behalf as set out above - complies with the applicable data protection regulations. Within ING Group, there are strict requirements included in internal policies and contractual arrangements in place to ensure that your personal data will only be processed for a specific purpose on the basis of an appropriate legal basis (taking into account any effect such processing may have on you) and that adequate organisational and technical measures have been implemented to protect your rights. We will also remain responsible for handling any request you may have in relation to your personal data protection rights as described below.

2. Other financial institutions and entities

We are always looking for new insights to help you get ahead in life and in business. For this reason, we exchange personal data (when it is legally allowed) with partners such as universities and other independent research institutions, who use it in their research and innovation. The researchers we engage must satisfy the same strict requirements as ING employees. When possible, the personal data will be shared at an aggregated level to ensure the results of the research are anonymous.

## Personal data protection statement

### Under what conditions do we transfer personal data outside the EEA ?

Whenever we share your personal data (if EU data protection laws apply) with third parties or other ING entities located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not offer an adequate level of data protection, we will make sure there are adequate measures in place to ensure that your personal data is sufficiently protected.
For this purpose, we rely on so-called transfer tools, such as:
• EU Model clauses or Standard Contractual Clauses; these are contractual clauses we agree with any external service providers located in a non-adequate country to ensure that such a provider is contractually obliged to provide an adequate level of data protection.
• Binding Corporate Rules; for personal data transfers within ING Group, we could also rely on binding internal Group policies (i.e. the Binding Corporate Rules) to ensure that ING entities located in a non-adequate country adhere to an adequate level of data protection when processing personal data c as set out in Section 4 (“Who do we share your personal data with and why ?”).
ING may also rely upon, amongst others:
• the respect of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework:
• the conclusion or the execution of an agreement, a transaction or a third-party transaction in your favour; • requirements based on applicable local laws and regulations; • data transfer that are necessary for reasons of public interests; • your explicit consent; • the respect of international treaties.
Furthermore, we will assess on a case-by-case basis whether any organisational, technical (such as encryption) and/ or contractual safeguards need to be implemented to ensure your personal data is adequately protected, taking into account the legal framework of the country where the data importer is located."

### Do we make automated decisions and engage in profiling?

Automated decision-making is when we make decisions by technological means without significant human involvement. Profiling involves the automated processing of personal data with a view to evaluating or predicting personal aspects such as the economic situation, reliability or likely behaviour of a person.
Since ING Belgium serves a wide group of customers, it makes the use of automated decision-making and profiling imperative. Examples are:
1. Credit risk rating
When you apply for a loan, a credit or a credit card, we create a profile to assess whether you can meet your financial obligations to us and to ensure that we do not offer loans, credits or credit cards that are not suitable for you. We assess the risk connected to a contract with you via a method called credit scoring. Your credit score is calculated based on automated decision-making. You have to achieve a pre-defined minimum score to ensure an acceptable risk for you and us.
The credit score is calculated mainly on your financial standing. Based on the personal data you provide in the credit-scoring process, we consult external credit (rating) registers (including the Central Individual Credit Register of the National Bank of Belgium) to acquire relevant financial information. If you already have or had a relationship with us in the past (taking into account applicable retention periods), we combine the (external) financial information with your internal payment history. If you do not achieve the minimum score, the automated credit scoring will decline your application. In that case, we will not enter into an agreement with you since we consider the risks for you and us to be too high. You have the right to contest such automated decisions. We refer to section 7 on how to do this.
2. Prevention of fraud and money laundering and terrorism financing
We are obliged or we need to perform customer and transaction screening to detect potential an actual criminal activity. As a result, we pay particular attention to unusual transactions and to transactions that - by their nature - result in a relatively high risk of fraud, money laundering or terrorism financing. To do this we create and maintain a risk profile for you. If we suspect that a transaction is connected with money laundering or terrorist financing, we are obliged to report this to the authorities.
Examples of factors that we take into account that may indicate an increased risk of fraud or money laundering and terrorist financing are:
• Changes in a person's normal spending and payment behaviour, such as unexpectedly large amounts being transferred or debited;
• Payments to or from suspicious countries, stores or addresses;
• Two PIN payments by a single person in two vastly different locations at the same time;
• Being listed on an internal referral register. This ING's register is a list that includes persons and institutions who have committed fraud or otherwise pose a risk to the financial sector or with whom we no longer want a relationship. They are a risk to ING, its staff and/or its customers. Only some employees of specific ING departments may have access to the details of the files on a need-to-know basis; Being listed on any public national or international sanctions lists."

## Personal data protection statement

### What are your rights and how do we respect them ?

If your personal data is processed, you have personal data protection rights. If you have questions about which rights apply to you, please get in touch with us, i.e. using the email address mentioned in Section 12 (“Contact and questions”).
You have the following rights:
**A) Right of access**
You have the right to ask us for an overview of your personal data that we process.
**B) Right to rectification**
If your personal data is incorrect, you have the right to ask us to rectify it. If we shared data about you with a third party and that data is later corrected, we will also notify that party accordingly.
C) Right to object to processing You have the right to object to processing at any time, by simple request and free of charge in accordance with the following.
You can object to ING using your personal data for its own legitimate interests if you have a justifiable reason. We will consider your objection and whether processing your personal data has any undue impact on you that would require us to stop processing your personal data.
You may not object to us processing your personal data if:
• we are legally required to do so; or
• it is necessary to conclude and fulfil a contract with you.
You can also object to receiving (personalised) commercial messages from us (e.g. by e-mail, mail and *You can also object to receiving (personalised* *– Direct Marketing* *) commercial messages from us (e.g. by e-mail, mail and phone) or to have your personal data used for statistical purposes.* *You may also object to the exchange of your data between ING Group companies, established in a member state of the European Union, for direct marketing purposes.*
When you become an ING customer, we may ask you whether you want to receive personalised commercial offers or information based on your payment data and other similar details. Should you later change your mind, you can choose to retrieve your consent of receiving these messages.
You can choose to opt out of receiving these (personalised) commercial messages by, amongst others:
• using the ‘unsubscribe' link at the bottom of commercials e-mails;
• adapting your Personal data protection settings in your ING Home'Bank / Business’Bank or ING Banking;
• filling in our contact form on www.ing.be;
• calling ING +32.2.464.60.04;
• visiting www.robinsonlist.be/index.html and www.dncm.be (FR) subscribing to Robinson Mail and the “Do Not Call Me List"".
In addition, even if you opt out of receiving commercial (personalised) offers, we will alert you to unusual activity on your account, such as:
• when your credit or debit card is blocked;
• when a transaction is requested from an unusual location.
**D) Right to object to automated decisions**
You have the right not to be subject to decisions which may legally or significantly affect you and that were based solely on automated processing using your personal data (including profiling). In such cases you may ask to have a person to make the decision instead. Some of our decisions are however the result of automated processes for which you gave us explicit consent or these decisions are necessary to conclude or fulfil a contract with you (e.g. in relation to credit scoring as explained above). In both cases, after the automated decision being made, you may ask for human intervention and contest the resulting decision (e.g. automatic refusal of an online credit application, based on credit scoring). Your right to object and to contest may be impeded if automated decisions are made for legal reasons.
**E) Right to restrict processing**
You have the right to ask us to restrict using your personal data if:
• you believe the personal data is inaccurate, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
• we are processing the personal data unlawfully;
• we no longer need the personal data, but you want us to keep it for use in a legal claim;
• you have objected to us processing your personal data for our own legitimate interests, during the verification into whether the legitimate aims pursued by us take precedence over your own interest.
**F) Right to data portability**
You have the right to ask us to transfer your personal data directly to you or to another company. This applies to personal data you have provided with us directly and that we process by automated means with your consent or on the basis of a contract with you. *You have the right to receive your personal data* *in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.* Where technically feasible, and based on applicable local law, we will transfer your personal data.
**G) Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**
You may ask us to erase your personal data, as soon as possible. However, ING is sometimes legally obliged to keep your personal data. Your right to be forgotten is only applicable if:
• we no longer need it for its original purpose;
• you withdraw your consent for processing it;
• you object to us processing your personal data for our own legitimate interests *and there are no compelling legitimate grounds for the processing* or for personalised commercial messages;
• ING unlawfully processes your personal data; or
• local law requires ING to erase your personal data.
**H) Right to complain**
Should you as a customer or as a customer’s representative be unsatisfied with the way we have responded to your concerns, you have the right to submit a complaint to us. If you are still unhappy with our response to your complaint, you can escalate it to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) of ING Belgium. You can also lodge a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority: Rue de la presse/Drukpersstraat 35, 1000 Brussels. (website: www.dataprotectionauthority.be).
**I) Right to withdraw consent**
If you have given your consent to us for specific processing of your personal data as set out in Section 3 (“What do we do with your personal data?“), you can withdraw your consent at any time. From that moment, we are no longer allowed to process your personal data. Please be aware that such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

If you want to exercise your rights or submit a complaint, please use the below details for ING Belgium.

In any case treating your request should not take longer than 1 month after receipt of your request. Should we require more time to complete your request, we will notify you immediately and provide reasons for the delay.

## Personal data protection statement

### Are you obliged to provide us with your personal data ?

In some cases, we are legally required to collect personal data or your personal data may be needed before we may perform certain services and provide certain products. We undertake to request only the personal data that is strictly necessary for the relevant purpose. Failure to provide the necessary personal data may cause delays or lead to refusal of certain products and services for instance loans or investments."

## Personal data protection statement

### How long do we keep your personal data?

We do not store your personal data longer than we need to for the purposes (as set out in Section 3 (“What do we do with your personal data?”)), for which we have processed it. Consequently, retention periods may depend on circumstances. When assessing how long to keep personal data, retention requirements might be stipulated by other applicable laws (e.g. anti-money laundering law *or* *the time limits for civil and criminal actions against us or you and the causes of interruption or suspension of these time limits* *).* Personal data collected in the context of conclusion or performance of an agreement can also be kept as evidence in litigation.
In most cases, the retention period will be 10 years after the end of our agreement (regarding your bank account) or business relationship with you or even up to 30 years for your mortgage loan data. Sometimes we use different storage periods. For example, if the supervisory authority requires us to store certain personal data longer (your identification data, the documentary evidence data and the recordings of the transactions, necessary to reconstruct precisely the Transactions made by you or made on your favour) or if you have filed a complaint that makes it necessary to keep the underlying personal data for a longer period. Other data collected by surveillance cameras are kept for shorter periods as required by law. Furthermore, insofar as the images recorded by the surveillance cameras in accordance with Section 2.A) cannot help to provide proof of an offence, damage or incivility, or cannot identify a perpetrator, a disturber of public order, a witness or a victim, they are not kept for longer than one month.
In addition, for the purposes of establishing credit risk models, your personal data relating to credit agreements are kept for a period of at least 20 years and (in particular for data relating to mortgages) for a maximum of 30 years after the end of these contracts. As far as possible, however, your data are pseudonymised or anonymised.
If we no longer need your personal data as described above, we delete or anonymise the personal data, in accordance with regulatory provisions and applicable law."

## Personal data protection statement

### Supplement 3 to the Personal data protection Statement of ING Belgium NV/SA: Automated decision making

You or any other person concerned might be the subject of a decision based only on automated processing, including profiling, which could have legal effects on you or significantly affect you in a similar way, in these cases:
**1. Establishment of an “individual assessment of Compliance risks” in connection with combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism**
*To accept you, representatives, agents* *,* *and beneficial owners,* *we prepare* *an individual assessment of risks* *. This is* *based on* *your* *characteristics* *(for example, identifying* *politically exposed persons) and the purpose and nature of the business relationship* *. We do this* *in connection with combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism (ML/FT) in accordance with the Law of 18 September 2017* *. Our main goal is to reduce* *the risk of the financial system being used for ML/FT. This individual assessment* *considers* *the global risk assessment required by the* *law. It looks at* *the purpose of the account or business relationship, the level of assets deposited, the volume of transactions* *, and* *the regularity or duration of the business relationship.* *We also consider* *factors* *that indicate* *potentially lower* *or* *higher risks:* *risks* *related to* *you, risks related to* *products, services, transactions* *,* *or distribution channels,* *and* *geographic risk factors. This individual assessment* *helps us evaluate your* *characteristics and the related ML/FT risk measurement* *. It allows us* *to* *implement* *proportionate and appropriate vigilance measures* *for* *the continuous assessment of the business relationship.*
*We prepare this based* *on the data* *you, your* *representative, agent* *,* *and beneficial owner* *provide. We also use* *documentary evidence or reliable and independent sources of information* *. These sources can be* *public* *, like* *the National Register of Natural Persons, the Belgian Official Gazette,* *and* *the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises* *,* *or private* *, like* *the World-Check risk detection service from LSEG* *.We update the* *individual assessment of* *you, your* *representatives, agents* *,* *and beneficial owners, as well as the global risk assessment* *, especially* *when* *there are changes* *relevant to the individual assessment* *.*
In line with the Law of 18 September 2017, we maintain constant and proportionate vigilance regarding the identified risk. This involves a careful automated examination of the transactions during the business relationship. We also check the source of the funds, if necessary, to ensure these transactions match your characteristics, the purpose and nature of the business relationship or the planned transaction, and your risk profile. This way, we can detect atypical transactions that need a detailed analysis.
If we know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds to suspect that funds, transactions, or attempted transactions are linked or may be linked to money laundering or the financing of terrorism, or if we are aware of something that is or may be connected to these activities, we are legally required to report this to the Financial Information Processing Unit (FIPU).
If you or your representative, agent, or actual beneficiary do not get a satisfactory evaluation result with us or receive a specific risk classification, we or another company in the ING Group, whether in the European Union or not, or an insurance company in the European Union (outside the ING Group), may refuse to start or continue a (pre)contractual relationship or carry out a Transaction you or a third party request on your behalf.According to the Law of 18 September 2017, you, your representatives, agents, and beneficial owners do not have the right to access personal data processed under money laundering prevention rules. You also do not have the right to correct your data, be forgotten, transfer your data, object, avoid profiling, or be informed about security issues. However, you can file a complaint with the Data Protection Authority mentioned in Section of this Declaration if you believe that processing your personal data breaches the EU Regulation. The Data Protection Authority will only inform you that they have conducted the necessary checks.
**2. Establishment of an “individual assessment of commercial risks”, especially to prevent and combat fraud and ensure the security of Transactions**
*To start or continue a relationship with us, or to carry out a banking, financial, insurance, or other Transaction you or* *a third party requests in your favor, we perform an ""individual assessment of commercial risks."" This means we evaluate you to place you in one of the risk classes. We do this to* fight fraud and keep Transactions secure, aiming to reduce financial or reputational risk for us.
This assessment helps us decide if you are a trusted person to transact with, ensuring the risks are either non-existent or minimal. We base this assessment on the data you or a third party provides, any incidents, defaults, or disputes we already know about, and external sources mentioned in Supplement 1 to this Personal data protection Statement. We regularly test and update our ""scoring"" methods to keep them accurate, effective, and impartial.If you do not achieve a satisfactory assessment result or fall into a particular risk class, we, another company of the ING Group, or an insurance company in the EU may refuse to start or continue a (pre-)relationship or perform a Transaction you or a third party requests in your favor.You can ask to share your viewpoint on the assessment outcome and challenge our decision by contacting one of our branches.
**3. Establishment of an “investor profile” to protect investors**
To offer “investment advice” services and buy or sell financial instruments for you, we create a MiFID investor profile for you. This means we assess your situation to provide these services and financial instruments. We do this before any service is carried out, following the European Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID). Our main goal is to understand you better and protect investors.
*When* *we give* *investment advice,* *we must check if* *the service and financial instruments* *are adequate and appropriate for you. This check helps us* *act in* *your* *best interests.* *To create your* *investor profile,* *we gather* *information about* *your* *investment* *goals,* *risk tolerance, financial situation, and* *your* *experience and knowledge of financial instruments.*
*We need to know* *about* *your* *experience and knowledge* *, including* *the types of services and financial instruments* *you know well* *, the nature, volume* *,* *and frequency of* *your* *financial instruments transactions* *, and your* *education* *level* *and profession.*
*We establish the* *MiFID investor profile* *based on (i) the data you provide (like your* *identity, financial situation, knowledge and experience of financial instruments, risk tolerance* *, and* *investment* *goals)* and (ii) any data we already have internally. We regularly update the methods for creating this profile to keep them accurate and effective.
The investor profile we prepare for you determines which services and/or financial instruments we can offer or sell to you. Your investor profile might mean we cannot offer you certain services and/or financial instruments. You can ask to share your opinion about our assessment and challenge the investment decision we made by contacting one of our branches.
**4. We also establish an “individual credit risk assessment” (or “credit score”) especially for managing credit risk and combating excessive debt**
***a) For business credits:***
*To grant* *and* *manage* *a business credit (including a credit card),* *we automatically prepare* *a “credit score* *”. This is* *an individual assessment* *we carry* *out to* *place you* *and,* *if needed* *, the person* *providing* *a personal security,* *into* *one of* *our* *credit risk classes* *.* *The main* *goal* *of* *this* *credit score is to* *lower* *the risk of* *you not* *being* *able* *to* *repay your credit. By* *preparing this “credit score* *”, we can evaluate your* *financial* *situation* *and,* *if needed* *, that of the person* *providing a personal security. We assess if you and, if applicable, the person providing* *a personal security,* *have enough* *creditworthiness and* *ability* *to repay the credit* *. This helps us* *make a responsible credit decision.*
*We prepare this* *“credit score”* *using data you provide, such as the* *purpose of the credit, income* *,* *and* *expenses. We also use* *data* *we* *already* *have, like* *payment* *information* *and* *credit* *repayment* *history* *with* *us, and* *data* *from the* *Individual Credit Register* *at* *the National Bank of Belgium.* *We regularly test and update our* *“scoring” methods* *to keep them* *accurate, effective* *,* *and* *impartial.If you do* *not* *achieve* *a satisfactory assessment result* *or fall into* *a particular risk class* *, we* *may* *refuse* *to offer or grant* *you* *credit* *. Alternatively, we might offer* *or* *grant* *the credit* *with* *different* *prices* *or conditions* *, possibly requiring* *additional guarantees or securities* *. If* *the person* *providing* *a personal security* *does* *not* *achieve* *a satisfactory assessment* *, we may refuse* *to enter into a security contract with* *them* *and,* *if needed, refuse* *to grant* *you* *credit* *.You can* *express* *your* *viewpoint* *about* *the assessment* *outcome* *and challenge* *our decision by* contacting a branch, your usual contact person at ING Belgium, or our telephone call centre.
**b) For consumer or mortgage credits and personal credit cards:**
You can consult the relevant General Terms by contacting us.
**5. Setting an ""individual appraisal of the interest rate on a credit”**
To grant and manage a credit, an assessment is carried out to define the specific interest rate on the credit. This interest rate considers the credit's characteristics (for example, the sum borrowed, the duration, and the repayment formula), the credit's purpose (for example, buying a primary residence or a new car), and the risk information linked with the credit (for example, “credit scoring” mentioned above, the level of borrowing compared to a property's value, or the income available for repayment). It also considers the securities (for example, mortgage registration), the general characteristics of borrowing clients, and your personal characteristics if you apply for the credit (for example, occupation). In this case, we develop a complete overview of your needs and can set up specific approaches for certain commercial sectors (for example, Private Banking). We can also offer rate reductions for certain credits linked with using other products (for example, insurance related to a mortgage loan).Creating this type of appraisal helps us consider the risks linked to the credit and its significance in your life and business. It also helps us to optimize how we allocate our capital across different credit portfolios. When we evaluate interest rates, we use data you provide during the credit application process, for example, any competing offers. We also use data we already have, like payment data and information about various ING Belgium products. We regularly test and update our scoring methods to keep them accurate, efficient, and fair. This appraisal might result in the credit being offered or granted at better or higher rates.
If you are affected, you can share your opinion on the appraisal result and dispute the decision by contacting an ING Belgium branch.
*We may process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophic beliefs or trade union membership as well as personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures may be* processed, including with a view to automated decision-making as laid down in Section 6 of this Statement, in connection with combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, in accordance with the relevant applicable legislation (particularly the Law of 18 September 2017), notably in connection with identifying politically exposed persons. The categories of people with access to such data are our members of staff and our intermediaries (independent agents or brokers) and, where applicable, of companies whose involvement is necessary or other ING Group companies established in a Member State of the European Union or insurance companies concerned (outside of the ING Group) established in a Member State of the European Union, tasked with carrying out the aforementioned purpose. Furthermore, we may process your health-related data, however, including with a view to automated decision-making as laid down in Article 6 of this Statement, via your explicit consent, when we operate as an insurance intermediary. In this event, you give your prior explicit consent to the processing of such data, in connection with the sub-contracting of such processing by the insurance companies concerned. The categories of people with access to such data are our members of staff and our intermediaries (independent agents or brokers) or insurance companies concerned (outside of the ING Group) established in a Member State of the European Union, whose involvement is necessary or useful for the conclusion of a life assurance policy. These people have a strict duty of confidentiality with regard to the processing of such data."

You can then pay and/or archive your Zoomit documents entirely online, however and whenever you want.

### How much does Zoomit cost?

Zoomit is completely free of charge and is part of our online banking service.

### How do I accept new Zoomit senders?

### How do I pay an invoice via Zoomit?

### How long will the documents remain available in zoomit?

Incoming Zoomit bills and other documents remain in your list of new documents until they are paid and/or viewed. They are then moved to your history.

You can also download and save your Zoomit documents on your computer, if you wish to keep a permanent record.

### Can I transfer my Zoomit documents to or from another bank?

If you change banks and want to continue receiving bills and other documents via Zoomit, you will need to give your new account number to your approved senders.

### Will I still receive paper documents if I use Zoomit?

Once you give permission for a sender to send you their documents via Zoomit, you will no longer receive them by post. However, there may be a short period of overlap, depending on the sender. Which means you may still receive paper documents at first. After that, you will only receive your documents electronically.

### Can I give someone else access to my Zoomit documents?

This includes all account holders and mandate holders. If you wish, you can also choose to keep your Zoomit documents private.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does a credit card work?

Unlike a debit card, payments made with a credit card are not immediately deducted from your bank account. Instead, they are postponed to a later date—often at the beginning or middle of the following month.
Visa Classic: each billing period closes on the 27th of the month. The total amount due for that period is automatically debited 9 calendar days later from the ING current account linked to your credit card.
Mastercard Gold: each billing period closes on the 7th of the month. The total amount due for that period is automatically debited 9 calendar days later from the ING current account linked to your credit card.

### What fees might I have to pay?

You pay a fixed annual fee (see comparison table above). If you paid in euros and there is enough money in your current account at the time of the monthly closing, no additional fees or interest will apply.
?? Important to know: fees are charged if you withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card. That’s why we recommend using your ING debit card for this type of withdrawal whenever possible, both in Belgium and abroad.

### When is it better to use an ING credit card instead of an ING debit card?

?? When making payments in currencies other than euros, because the exchange margin is lower (2% vs 3.9%). However, it’s still best to use your ING debit card for ATM withdrawals whenever possible.
?? A credit card is also very practical for making large purchases at the end of the month, since the amount is only debited from your account later—often at the beginning or middle of the following month.
??? Lastly, every payment made with your credit card is automatically covered by additional insurance. ?? When in doubt, it’s always better to use your credit card for major purchases or holiday bookings.

### What is the difference between an account statement and a duplicate?

By statement of account we mean the original statement. You can only request an account statement once on paper.
A duplicate is an official copy of an account statement. It therefore also mentions the same information about the transactions that you have performed in a certain period. With electronic statements, originals and duplicates are 100% identical.
You can request electronic duplicates of the last 10 years for free via Home'Bank or via Business'Bank . You can also request paper statement duplicates (e.g. if your account has been closed or if you need your statement to be sent to a different address) by contacting us . They cost 30 euros per 12-month period.

### What to do if my account statements or duplicates have disappeared?

We keep the last 10 statements generated for each account, e.g. • if you have daily statements: the last 10 working days. • if you have monthly: the last 10 months.
You can only download account statements when the due date of the account statements has been reached and there has been a movement in the account since the last account statement. Check the due date and frequency of the statement extracts in Home'Bank or Business'Bank .
You can generate any statement you need under the “Duplicates” tab. It has the same legal value as the original statement.
When duplicates have been requested, you have a period of 7 calendar days to download them.
If you do not download them within that period, you can request duplicates again in Home'Bank or Business'Bank."

Reading time: 3 min 11 October 2018 Paperwork takes up a lot of space in our lives. Every day documents sent by post and e-mail pile up. Yet you can reduce your paper consumption by digitalising your document!

## Digital documents: the same legal value as paper

Tax returns, pay slips, invoices, guarantees, rental agreements… Year after year the files stack up. What can you do to cut such paper consumption?
For a start, you can choose digital documents wherever possible instead of paper documents. In the past everything needed to be stored in paper format. But these days, documents can be digitalised. Electronic documents now have the same legal equivalence as paper documents.
> Electronic documents now have the same legal equivalence as paper documents.


## Digitalisation: how does it work?

The form in which you keep your documents is no longer an issue. You can just as easily save your documents electronically on your computer, on an external hard drive, or on a cloud server. Start to save space straightaway by **digitalising your documents** . Plus, using less paper is also good for the environment!
The golden rule when saving documents is that **you should save the original document.** Store the electronic document as you received or downloaded it. As this electronic document is the original. If the document is attached to an email, save this e-mail too as proof of receipt. A digital document is also easier to send or forward by e-mail. You can still print out a paper version of the electronic document but any printed version will then no longer be considered as an original but as a copy.
Many companies now send their payslips digitally. You can receive **your electricity, gas and water bills by e-mail or download them online** . You can even fill in and submit your tax returns online via Tax-on-web. Some shops have already made the switch to electronic receipts. A number of retailers even offer the option to save your guarantee on your e-ID card. To familiarise yourself with digital documents, why not opt for electronic account statements too?"

## Your account statements in electronic format: the benefits

### Electronic account statements offer numerous advantages.

* **Save space**
By law you are obliged to **store account statements for five years** . The tax authorities can even ask to go back seven years. If the statements relate to debt repayments, you must keep them for ten years. For this entire time, paper statements will be collecting dust and taking up space. But in digital form, these account statements take up no space at all! It is also much easier to find and manage your documents on your computer.
* **Save money**
Electronic statements are also great for your wallet as you will not pay any postage.
* **Save time**
You will also save considerable time as you no longer need to go to a branch and it is up to you to decide how you manage your account statements. Unlike statements sent by post, you will not risk losing them.

## How to switch to digital statements

The digital format means that we will not send you any more paper statements and you will not have to print out any statements at a branch. Using Home'Bank, simply select the accounts for which you would like to receive electronic statements. You can then manage, request, download and digitally archive your account statements 24/7.
You can download your account statements easily and securely via Home'Bank. Statements for the last 24 months are always available online and if you want to print a statement, you can. What if your computer crashes? We also store your statements in our systems. Older statements can always be obtained from a branch. Which means there are no risks for you!"

Reading time: 5 min 17 March 2025 You have questions about using your ING card? Here is some useful information.
Don’t hesitate to take a look at the back of your monthly statement. You will find important information there.

### How do I repay the amount spent with my ING Card?

2 options :
* **You can repay your total spend in one go** . If you repay it before the 5th of the following month, **you will not pay any interest** .
* **You repay with several instalments** . You repay the mandatory minimum amount (10% of the amount of your total spending with a minimum of 25 EUR) and you repay the remainder at your convenience. Debit interest is applied to the outstanding balance (variable rate depending on the amount of your credit limit).

### What interest rate is applied?

The interest rate is communicated on an annual basis and expresses the debit interest due in the event of drawdown of the ING Card overdraft facility. In practice, it is calculated and applied on a monthly basis on the amounts not reimbursed, in proportion to the time elapsed.
The interest rate is indicated on the monthly statement.

### Why do I have to pay back a minimum monthly amount?

According to the conditions laid down by law and included in your ING Card contract, the amount to be refunded monthly represents by default 10% of the total amount of your purchases (with a minimum of 25 euros per month).
The information on the mandatory minimum monthly refund is indicated on the monthly statement, in the lower part: “This amount of xxxxx€ will be automatically debited from your account BExx xxxx xxxx.”
The minimum monthly amount to be refunded applies if there is still an outstanding balance on your ING card, even if you have not used your card recently.
This amount is automatically deducted from your ING Card account on the first day of the month following receipt of your expenditure statement.
If you do not have an ING current account, you must transfer the amount to your ING Card account yourself.
If you do not repay the minimum monthly amount due from your ING Card, you will receive a reminder letter explaining the steps to follow. ING may also be required to terminate the contract and block your card."

### Why do I have to pay back the entire balance on a specific date (zero balancing)?

The credit linked to the ING Card cannot be used indefinitely. According to the Consumer Credit Law, the holder of an ING Card must repay in full the amount used after a period fixed by law (called **zero balancing period** ).
**The end date of this zero balancing period is indicated on the monthly statement:** ‘Zero-balancing: the total outstanding balance must be paid back by xx/xx/xxxx at the latest.’
For the zero balancing to take effect, your ING Card balance must remain at zero or above zero for at least 48 hours.
Warning letters are mailed to you 8 months and 2 months before the deadline to remind you of your repayment obligation.

### What if I don't pay off the balance in full on time?

If you do not repay the balance of your ING Card in full by the end of the zero balancing period, you are in breach of your credit agreement.
You will receive a reminder letter explaining the steps to follow and ING may be forced to terminate the contract and block your card.

### How to transfer money to my ING Card credit card to raise my payment limit?

You can temporarily increase your card limit by transferring funds to your ING Card account: your credit card limit will be increased by the amount of the transfer. Funds are available within two business days.
It is not possible to permanently increase the limit of your ING Card."

### Why is ING adapting its branch network?

In the last few years, clients have increasingly used remote banking transactions, which offer greater flexibility and save time. This has gone hand in hand with less frequent visits to branches.

### My branch is closing. How do I contact ING?

* If you are a retail customer, you can manage many transactions yourself through the ING Banking app or Home'Bank .
* If you are a business client, you can manage many transactions yourself through the Business'Bank .
* If you need to talk with one of our employees, you can make an appointment with another branch , or contact your Personal/Private/Business Banker or your Relationship Manager.

### Will my (dedicated) contact person stay the same?

Maintaining a trust relationship with your bank is key. So we will do our best to ensure that you keep the same (dedicated) contact person.
In any case if you have a Personal Banker, a Private Banker, a Business Banker or a Relationship Manager, your contact person should remain the same."

Reading time: 8 min 15 September 2024 Considering opening a savings account for a minor? Many Belgian families open a savings account for their child when they are under 18. So if you’ve been thinking about a child savings account or grandchild savings account, let’s see which solution would be best for you.
A regulated savings account for a child is similar to a regulated savings account for an adult. It is a flexible savings option.
Money invested in a regulated savings account is protected by the Deposit Guarantee Fund up to €100,000\* (per customer and per bank)."

## Who can open a savings account for a minor child?

Three different cases may arise.
1. You are a parent or legal representative (guardian) and you want to open a savings account for your child.
2. You are a grandparent and you want to open a savings account for your grandchild.
3. You are not related to the child and you want to open a savings account for them.
In all three cases, this is possible. You can open a savings account to help your child in the future!"
https://www.ing.be/en/individuals/saving/savings-account-for-a-child;3;524;524.936113815071435782.txt;"# Child savings accounts for under-18s and grandchildren - ING Belgium - Everything you need to know about child savings accounts for children under 18

## Who can open a savings account for a minor child?

### 1. You are a parent or legal representative (guardian) and you want to open a savings account for an under-18 year old child.

As a parent, you have the possibility of opening a savings account in your own name or in the name of your child.
The difference lies in who owns the money. If the money belongs to the minor, the account must be opened in his or her name, whereas if the money belongs to you, you have the option of opening the account in your name or in the minor's name.
At ING, as at most banks in Belgium, the account is opened in the name of the child who holds it, but you, as the parent or guardian, remain responsible for it until your child turns 18.
When you open an account in your child’s name, this money is presumed to belong to your child and you are required to manage it as a prudent and reasonable person. On the other hand, if you open the savings account in your own name, the money belongs to you.
This difference is significant were the parent to die or have their property seized. If the account is opened in your child's name, the money is presumed to belong to him or her, and there are no inheritance procedures to follow in the event of the parents' death. However, if the savings account is in your name, this money belongs to you (unless proven otherwise) and the inheritance rules must be applied. A fair distribution of your money between your various assigns is provided for by law (in the absence of a will). This money will be transferred through a notary (the assigns will also have to pay inheritance tax). If you want this money to go solely to the child for whom you opened the savings account (within the limit of the portion available, if applicable), it must be specified in your will, bearing in mind that there is a risk that your assigns may appeal this decision. You also have the option of making a gift to the child (or other person) of your choice to leave them the amount of your choice (bearing in mind that your assigns may appeal this decision).
The advantages and disadvantages of a savings account in your name or in the name of your child should therefore be weighted up according to your particular circumstances."

## Who can open a savings account for a minor child?

### 2. You are a grandparent and you want to open a savings account for your under-18 year old grandchild.

In Belgium, grandparents cannot open a savings account in the name of their grandchildren but don’t worry, we have a solution for everything! The third party stipulation. Don’t go, wait a minute! You’ll see, it’s very simple.
The third party stipulation allows you to open a savings account in your name and to designate a beneficiary who will become the sole holder on a certain date.
In this case, as a grandparent, you will be the original holder and the child will be the beneficiary.
On the date you choose, the beneficiary, i.e. the child, will become the sole holder of the savings account and you the grandparent will no longer be able to consult or manage the account. This mechanism transfers ownership of the savings account and the money in the account from you to that child. This child can therefore become the owner of this savings account, for example on his or her 18th or 25th birthday. What a great gift!
This option can be changed, the chosen date can be changed during the life of the product, the holder (i.e. you the grandparent) can decide to change or delete the beneficiary and remain the sole holder. Please note that once the beneficiary, your grandchild (or his or her parents), has accepted the stipulation, or once the account has been officially transferred to him or her on the specified date, it will no longer be possible for the original holder, i.e. you as the grandparent, to go and take back control of the account."

## Who can open a savings account for a minor child?

### 3. You are not related to a child and you want to open a savings account for them.

In Belgium, if you do not have a family relationship with a child, you cannot open a savings account in the name of that child but don’t worry, we have a solution for everything. The third party stipulation! Don’t go, wait a minute! You’ll see, it’s very simple.
The third party stipulation allows you to open a savings account in your name and to designate a beneficiary who will become the sole holder on a certain date.
Let's imagine you're the child’s godparent. You, as godparent, will be the initial holder and the child will be the beneficiary.
On the date you choose, the beneficiary, i.e. the child, will become the sole holder of the savings account and you the godparent will no longer be able to consult or manage the account. This mechanism transfers ownership of the savings account and the money in the account from you to that child. This child can therefore receive ownership of this savings account, for example on their 18th or 25th birthday. What a great gift!
This option can be changed, the chosen date can be changed during the life of the product, the holder (i.e. you the grandparent) can decide to change or delete the beneficiary and remain the sole holder. Please note that once the beneficiary, your grandchild (or his or her parents), has accepted the stipulation, or once the account has been officially transferred to him or her on the specified date, it will no longer be possible for the original holder, i.e. you as the grandparent, to go and take back control of the account.
It is important to bear in mind that inheritance tax in this case can be very high. You should therefore check the impact of inheritance tax on your assets."

## When can I open a savings account for a minor child?

As a parent or legal representative, you can open a savings account in your own name for your child even before they are born. From the 6th month of pregnancy, you will receive the number of their savings account... A useful piece of information you can include with the birth cards you send out!
If you are a grandparent, godparent, uncle or friend of the family and you want to open a savings account for a child, you will need to be a little more patient than the parents. You can only open the savings account for the child after the child is born (see options above)."

## Which savings account should I choose for a minor child?

You have a choice of three categories of savings account:
1. A traditional savings accounts – category A
2. A recurring savings accounts – category B
3. The savings account reserved for a specific age group - category C
The legal category refers to the conditions that apply to this account.
Category A has no conditions. You can pay money into the account with no limit on the amount and in any way you want (direct individual transfers or a regular standing order). There is no age limit or condition on the basic interest rate or loyalty bonus.
Amount conditions apply to category B accounts. A minimum or maximum amount may be stipulated.
Category C applies age conditions. This is a savings account reserved for a specific category (for example, a youth account).
Savings accounts offer a two-part return ( click here for more details), which depends on the account category. Conditional Category B and C accounts often offer a better return than unconditional Category A accounts.
4. The basic rate: this is the rate acquired at the latest the day after the money is paid into the savings account until the day of withdrawal.
   1. The basic rate is paid once a year, in January, and is calculated every day at the latest on the day after the deposit is made.
5. The loyalty bonus: this bonus is only earned on amounts that remain continuously in the regulated savings account for at least 12 months following the deposit.
   1. The loyalty bonus is paid quarterly (April, July, October and January) and is calculated only on the amount that has remained in the account for 12 consecutive months.
Interest rates may vary and the bank is required to inform you in advance.
In the event of a change in rate, the basic interest rate applies in proportion to the time passed. The loyalty bonus rate in effect at the time of payment or at the start of a new period remains unchanged for a period of 12 months.
Good to know! For 2024, interest up to €1,020 is exempt from withholding tax. Withholding tax of 15% is applied to interest over the above sum.
We would be very happy if you trust us with your child’s savings account. Discover and compare the savings accounts we offer, as well as the interest rates. You'll find all the essential information for savers."

## Do you want to invest for an under-18 year old child?

Check out our investment options Two types of life insurance are available in Belgium: branch 21 life insurance, which is considered to be a savings product with a guaranteed return and branch 23 life insurance which can be considered to be a strategy for a long-term investment in various assets of your choice: equities, bonds or real estate funds.
Branch 23 offers higher returns than a savings account but nevertheless carries some risk because it is subject to some volatility. Investing in an investment fund through a branch 23 life insurance product enables you to enjoy the benefits of life insurance combined with the potential of an investment fund. The value may therefore rise as well as fall, meaning that the risk is higher than with a capital-guaranteed life insurance policy. Over the longer term, investing in an investment type life insurance may provide a higher return, however this is not guaranteed. The underlying fund does not offer capital protection nor a capital guarantee.
Branch 21 is also a form of life insurance, with a lower return than branch 23 but with higher capital protection (with or without a capital guarantee).
